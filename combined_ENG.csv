"May 18, 2006 ANTH 250 Prof. Tavárez Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others. This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong. Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices. One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language. The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry. In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers. Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key. Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia. Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages. The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries. One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system. Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land. This was in turn replaced by the repartimento; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded. In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers. The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century. Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture. The Marxists, on the contrary, argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity. However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7). In Colombia this resulted in a civil war between the Liberal and Communist parties and Conservative party. A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response. Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples. This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25). This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts. In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced. The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158). The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements. By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82). Central to these was the question of indigenous identity: largely lost amidst the overwhelming Spanish influence, local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots and redefine what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture. Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people. Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739). Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734). The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool. It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse . The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181). A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society. This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior. Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736). By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority. Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language. Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85). The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82). It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84). Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109). The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2). This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other. In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole. A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57). Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty. While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities. They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52). The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity: no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era. The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58). The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999. Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158). It failed, despite the Mayan majority; possible reasons include the overwhelming illiteracy rates among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting stations (Warren 2002: 149, 151). However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172). Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733). Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion. While largely symbolic, it is still significant in that Guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than Spanish. This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia. Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view the reduction of their language to the status of ""dialect"" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive. In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves. An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single “ethnic group”, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4). Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture. Indigenous cosmology, or “cosmovision”, is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains a concept of culture, defined as “the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature” (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought. Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations. The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with. It is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level; however, with widely differing concepts of justice a a balance is difficult to achieve. Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships: tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime, but may have influenced the accused to do so. When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole. Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal. (Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97). Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision. The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59). This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing (Rappaport 2005: 93, 236). Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself. Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries. The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165). This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use. Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop. Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use. The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought. In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new. The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005). In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so. Illiteracy and poverty is associated with Maya; thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique Mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions, which most often occurs under Spanish influence. A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture. The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85). Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself. The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences. Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5). There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom. An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67). This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed. In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress; the pan-Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law. In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8). Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws (Jackson 1995: 5). Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever-persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment.

"Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching Sonia Roberts 11/27/07 Introduction Background Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years. Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society. Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler. Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees, ants and cockroaches, and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already (Halloy et al, 2007). No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them. Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots. I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot (hereafter referred to as Antie) that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest, switching between the foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors. Environment The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain. The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in the desert (Gordon, 54), where only a few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow (Gordon, 51). Other insects and creatures, including other species of ants, are present in the desert, but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals (Gordon, 7-11). Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive (Gordon, 11). Because of this, I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie, and will not create a fighting behavior. Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil. The Ant & the Robot Ants of this species are of two types: breeding ants (queens and drones) and sterile female workers. Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year. The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging. Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest. Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest, but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest (midden work) occurs close enough to the surface to be observable. Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987). It is therefore these three behaviors that I would like to focus on in this proposal: the others remain a bit too mysterious to yet model, and the ability of a robot to pass undetected in the depths of a colony would be very difficult to observe. These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems. In the case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of the nest, and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum (or until stimulated to switch behaviors). Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling. An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit. Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest. An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is. This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998). In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest. Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks (as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task), walk, navigate both within and outside of the nest, and of course switch tasks at appropriate times. The Agent Chassis Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system. Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included. Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors. Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization. A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs. Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging. These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted. Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance. For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day. A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached. (Fig 1) Sensors In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors. In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae. On its front grippers, Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure. The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function. The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius. Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation. Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes. These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5). The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects. The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function. The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions. The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern. These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer (Labhart, et al, 2002). Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers. (Fig 2) The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest: Upon each exit from the nest, Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky, and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later. This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning. Fig. 2. Diagram of the polarization-opponent unit described by Lambrinos, et al (2000). The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier, which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes. The e-vector (heading) returned from the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes (1, 2) follows a cos2-function. Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information. These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n-alkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task, perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun, causing a different ratio of n-alkanes to n-alkenes and the presence of branched n-alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile (Wagner, et al, 2001, as cited in Gordon & Greene, 2003). Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate (Arnold, et al, 1996, as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi, 1999), receptors to detect food, and receptors for three types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest, and those marking piles of trash as midden. Research shows that successful foragers returning to the nest do have a different effect on the inactive workers than unsuccessful foragers returning (Schafer, et al, 2006). Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007). Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35). For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone. All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks, with four of each type of receptor per stalk. This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots. The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on-board PC. Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object. These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson, et al (Patent #4,492,949), and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage. These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects. A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant’s sensory system is provided below. Fig 3. Table of sensors and their relations to the ant.

There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs. Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers, emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles. A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head. Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs. These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt. Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task, on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants. Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section. The Behavior Antie will have a hybrid software architecture: a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors, but many sub-behaviors will operate on a schema basis. Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked. Common Behaviors A few sub-behaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior. To ease Antie’s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines. The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference: // number representing calibration for speed double calibrate = 0; // constant representing the light at sunrise double sunrise; // outputs double left_motor_OP = 0;// left wheel motor double right_motor_OP = 0; // right wheel motor // inputs double photo_IP;// photoreceptor double temp_IP;// thermometer // Array inputs from left and right midden pheromone // detectors. Assume a function to determine more precise // location, returning these variables: double left_midden_IP; double right_midden_IP; // Array inputs from left and right alkene sensors. Assume a // function to determine location: double left_alk_avg_IP; double right_alk_avg_IP; // Array inputs from left and right successful forager // sensors. Assume a function to determine location: double left_sucfor_IP; double right_sucfor_IP; // Array inputs from left and right “successful patroller” // sensors. Assume a function to determine location: double left_sucpat_IP; double right_sucpat_IP; // Array inputs from left and right nestmate hydrocarbon // detectors. Assume a function to determine location: double left_hydrocarb_IP; double right_hydrocarb_IP; // Array inputs from left and right chemical seed detectors. // Assume a function to determine location: double left_seed_IP; double right_seed_IP; // inputs from left and right sonar sensors: double left_sonar_IP; double right_sonar_IP; // Booleans representing detection boolean food_detect = false; // is an object food? boolean midden_detect = false; // is an object midden? boolean nestmate_detect = false; // is an object a nestmate? boolean sucfor_detect = false; // successful forager boolean forager_detect = false; // forager boolean midworker_detect = false; // midden worker poolean patroller_detect = false; // patroller boolean sucpat_detect = false; // successful patroller // thresholds at which inputs may be declared to // have been detected double food_threshold; double midden_threshold; double hydrocarb_threshold; // nestmate hydrocarbons boolean forage_active = false; // activation status as forager Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside, in-nest navigation, an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and the identification of other ants. For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed. // Forward cruise // Takes in a number representing the desired speed. // Causes robot to cruise forward at said speed. // Speeds assumed to be on a 1-10 scale (10 being fastest). void forCruz(double speed) { // Each wheel input ""gets"" the appropriate speed // Calibrate is a double representing a calibration // initialized to zero and altered as necessary. // The robot will receive the “GO” command as long as // this function is running. left_motor_OP = speed + calibrate; right_motor_OP = speed; } // end forCruz A similar rotate function will be used to orient Antie towards a particular heading. // Rotate // Takes in a desired angle to rotate the robot and // rotates accordingly // Assume that 10s is sufficient to rotate the robot // completely around one wheel; this may be changed // in implementation. void rotate(int angle) { // If angle to turn is to the right, rotate left wheel // for a portion of 10s in accordance with desired // angle's proportion of a circle if(angle>0) { while ([timer] < 10 * angle / 360) { left_motor_OP = 5; right_motor_OP = 0; } // else rotate right wheel for appropriate portion of 10s else { while ([timer] < 10 * angle / 360) { left_motor_OP = 0; right_motor_OP = 5; } // end while } // end else } // end rotate These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis, and when combined with the forward cruise function, should cause the robot to move at an angle. In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location. The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al. Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance. We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters. The first function might look something like this: // Nest Orient // Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs // and returns the location of the nest in degrees. int nestOrient(double left_POL_IP, double right_POL_IP) { int degrees = 0; // Calculates direction of nest, and returns as degrees. return degrees; } // end nestOrient The second function, which would return the distance in centimeters, might look something like this: // Nest Distance // Takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs // and returns the current distance to the nest. int nestDist(double left_POL_IP, double right_POL_IP) { int dist = 0; // Calculates distance from nest, returning distance in cm. return dist; } // end nestDist In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source. To exit, Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek a lower temperature. The code may look something like this: // Exit Nest // Uses temperature gradient to navigate towards the nest // entrance from inside void nestExit() { // Reads temperature, scoots forward 1s, reads temperature // again, takes the difference, and determines whether current // heading is increasing temperature reading. If not, rotates // 45 degrees and tries again. while(photo_IP < sunrise) { double temp = temp_IP; while([timer] < 1){ forCruz(5); } temp -= temp_IP; if(temp>0) rotate(45); } // end nestExit To enter the nest, such as at the end of a task, Antie will perform the same function, except it will seek a lower temperature instead of a higher temperature, it will avoid light, and it will only activate while Antie is less than 10cm from the nest entrance. This void function will be called nestEnter(), and will take in no inputs. To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function. Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount, and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction. Regardless, this will be a very simple function. I will include one example: // Escape // Escapes from danger when bump sensors or sonar are // activated. void escape() { // Declare and initialize left bump sensors in // order from front to back. bump_left1; bump_left2; bump_left3; bump_left4; // Declare and initialize right bump sensors in // order from front to back. // Sonar sensors are globally declared. if(bump_left1) { // reverse … (at reduced speed) forCruz(-3); // … and rotate! rotate(45); } } // end escape Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds. Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them. This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated. Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell. Objects will include midden and food. The code may look something like this: // Object Identification // Identifies an object that has snuck up on the // unsuspecting robot. void objID() { // Declare and initialize front bump sensor. // Sonar sensors are globally declared. // Check inputs to determine which smell is strongest // if food smell is detected at higher rate and // above the food threshold for detection, Antie // assumes object is food while (bump_front || (sonar_left_IP && sonar_right_IP)) { if(((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) < ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP)) && ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP) > food_threshold) { food_detect = true; } // if midden smell is detected at higher rate // and above threshold for midden detection, // Antie assumes object is midden else if(((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) > ((left_food_IP + right_food_IP)) && ((left_midden_IP + right_midden_IP) > midden_threshold) { midden_detect = true; } } // end objID Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it. A simple void function grip() taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached, at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying. A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse. Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors. Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones. As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk. The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.” Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models. Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine. Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis: // Follow Gradient // Follows a generic chemical gradient, seeking a higher // concentration. void gradientFollow() { // Compares left and right inputs and activates opposite // motor to a greater degree. if (left_IP > right_IP) { [schema] { rotate(-90); forCruz(5); } // end schema } // end if if (right_IP > left_IP) { [schema] { rotate(90); forCruz(5); } // end schema } // end if else forCruz(5); } // end gradientFollow For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden(). All three are void and take no inputs. The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants. When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate. As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest. Research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of n-alkenes to n-alkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched n-alkanes. The difference in ratio is caused by the time ants spend outside in the sun, which depletes their n-alkene levels. Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels. The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this: // Ant Identification // Identifies an ant that has snuck up on the // unsuspecting robot. void antID() { while (left_sonar_IP && right_sonar_IP) { // Are hydrocarbons present? (Is this a nestmate?) if((left_hydrocarb_IP + right_hydrocarb_IP) > hydrocarb_threshold) { nestmate_detect = true; // In what task is the nestmate engaged? if (n-alkene level is appropriate for a forager) { forager_detect = true; } if (n-alkene level is appropriate for a patroller) { patroller_detect = true; } if (n-alkene level is appropriate for a midden worker) { midworker_detect = true; } // If not midden work, foraging or patrolling, ignore } // If not nestmate, ignore } } // end antID Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded. Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996). Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age (ex., Ingram, et al, 2005) and partially as a function of interactions with other workers (ex., Schafer et al, 2006; Gordon, 2002; Greene & Gordon, 2007). Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest. As a result, I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in. Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior. Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors. The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior. It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise, and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC, at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest. As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden. A program encoding this behavior might look like this: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // MIDDEN WORK ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // Antie will leave nest in the morning after sunrise, // carrying bits of midden halfway down the nest mound // and depositing them. Antie will return to the nest and // repeat this task until the temperature reaches above // 52 degrees Celsius. void midden() { // Initiated by sunrise, stopped by temperature while (photo_IP > sunrise && temp_IP < 52) { // Find midden and identify any found objects. If // they are midden, grip and carry outside nest. findMidden(); objID(); if(midden_detect) { grip(); nestExit(); // cruise to halfway down the nest mound while(nestDistance() < 25) { forCruz(); } release(); // reset midden_detect midden_detect = 0; nestEnter(); } // end if } // end while } // end midden The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling. Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest. This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age. Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005). It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling. In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34). Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60). To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones. This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45). The code may look something like this: // Explore // Takes in desired distance from nest to explore // in cm and moves in a slightly randomized zigzag // pattern void explore(int distance, int time) { // Local Variables int time=0; // integer representing the time to // wander one direction int angle=0; // integer representing number of // degrees to rotate int dir=0; // integer representing the direction to // turn (0=right, 1=left) // Random number generator to add a bit of wanderlust RandomGenerator rGen = new RandomGenerator(); // While loop; robot will keep zigging and zagging // for a set amount of time while ([timer] < time) { if (ant's distance from nest < distance) { // int time gets a random number of seconds // between 3 and 10 time = rGen.nextInt(3,10); // int angle gets a random number of degrees // between 15 and 75 angle = rGen.nextInt(15,75); // function call to rotation subroutine // if dir is 0, rotate to the right; if dir // is 1, rotate to the left. if (dir==0) { dir = 1; // dir changes direction- turn // left next time rotate(angle); // rotate to the right } else { dir = 0; // dir changes direction- turn // right next time rotate(-angle); // rotate to the left } // end rotation call // while loop to count down number of seconds // using a timer while ( [timer] < time) { // command to go forward is given goForward = 1; // call to forward cruise function; // straight cruise forCruz(5,5); } // end timer while loop } // end distance from nest while loop // if ant is approaching the desired distance, // double back (at angle) to explore more! if (ant's distance from nest == distance - some small constant) { rotate(135); } // end if // Avoid leaving nest territory else if (nestmate pheromones IP < very low threshold) { while([short timer]) { forCruz(5); // explore a bit further } // end while rotate(45); } // end if } // end if (distance from nest < distance) } // end explore Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again. Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow. A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food. Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis): ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // PATROLLING ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // // Main patrolling behavior function. // Includes nest patrolling, trail patrolling and the // stimulation and thresholds to initiate and switch between // the two. // Nest Patrolling // Patrollers' first job of the day: exit the nest and // explore the nest mound, taking measurements. void nestPatrol() { while (photo_IP > [light at sunrise] && temp_IP < 52 degrees Celsius ) { nestExit(); // Nest mounds are generally up to 1m across // Thus, explore in a 50cm radius (Gordon, 6) explore(50, 120); [schema] { rotate(nestOrient()); forCruz(5); nestEnter(); } wait a short time } // end if } // end nestPatrol // Trail Patrolling // Patrollers exit nest and attempt to find food. Once food // is found, they mark a trail leading back to it while // taking the most efficient route home. void trailPatrol() { while (photo_IP > [light at sunrise] && temp_IP < 52 degrees Celsius ) { nestExit(); // Explore no further than about 15m from nest, for no // more than 20 minutes if (food_IP > some low threshold){ findFood(); if (food_detect) { [schema] { rotate(nestOrient()); forCruz(5); spray “successful patroller” pheromone nestEnter(); } wait a short time } } else { explore(1500, 20 * 60); [schema] { rotate(nestOrient()); forCruz(5); nestEnter(); } wait a short time } } // end if } // end trailPatrol For the task-switching in the patrolling behavior, assume some variable “age” that Antie has been keeping track of using the CPU’s clock pulses to track the time since its last bootup. The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks. // PATROLLING // Task-switching hierarchy for the two types of patrolling void patrol() { while (age > nestpatrol_age && age < trailpatrol_age) { nestPatrol(); } while (age > trailpatrol_age && age < forage_age) { trailPatrol(); } } The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R. Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume. This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest. This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them. It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise. The code for this, adapted from Russell’s paper, might look like this: // Hex-path search // Localizes an object through sand using chemical detection void hexSearch() { double intense1 = inensity at n-1; double intense2 = intensity at n-2; while (nothing in grippers) { if (((intense2 > intense 1) && last rotation was counterclockwise) || (((intense2 < intense1) && last rotation was clockwise)) { rotate(-60); while([short timer]) { forCruz(5); } } // end if else { rotate(60); while([short timer]) { forCruz(5); } // end while } // end else } // end while } // end hexSearch Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47). To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon. The code might look like this: ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // FORAGING ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // // Main foraging behavior function. // Foragers will exit the nest upon activation and follow // a trail laid by the patrollers. Upon completion of the // trail-following, will locate and grip food, returning // to the nest. Boolean forage_today represents Antie’s // activation status for each day once it has switched to // the foraging behavior. void forage() { // Wait for a successful patroller to return. if (sucpat_detect) forage_today = true; while (forage_today && temp_IP < 52) { nestExit(); trailFollow(); // Follow successful patroller trail. // Note that this is NOT a schema basis, which would // cause Antie to stop and retrieve food encountered en // route. // When end of plume is reached, retrieve food. while (!food_detect) { // while food has not yet been found, continue searching // and identifying found objects hexSearch(); objID(); } // Once that loop has been broken, return to nest [schema] { // grip food and return to nest grip(); rotate(nestOrient()); forCruz(5); nestEnter(); } // release food just inside nest entrance release(); } // end while } // end forage Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors. Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work. Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot. To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling. The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002). Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate. According to Schafer’s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue. For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers. The code to model this task-switching might look something like this: ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // TASK-SWITCHING ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // // Main function of Antie’s software. Examines the task- // switching criteria and determines when Antie will perform // what behavior. Int “age” is an integer representing the // time since Antie’s last boot, corresponding to the age // of an ant being simulated. Int nestpatrol_age refers to the // starting age at which Antie will begin to nest patrol; // forage_age refers to the starting age at which Antie may be // activated to forage. This would correspond to the change in // gene expression described by Gordon (2002). main() { // default to midden work while (age < nestpatrol_age) { midden(); } // end while // switch to patrolling behavior based on age while (nestpatrol_age < age && age < forage_ave) { patrol(); } // end while // switch to foraging as a function of time, but // remain inactive until stimulated by returning // successful foragers // Assume that inactive foragers will not smell different // from patrollers, which was their last task, because // they have not yet spent sufficient time in the sun. if (sucfor_detect at time n-1 == false && sucfor_detect at time n == 1) { 0.0035 probability: forage_active = true; } while (age > forage_age && forage_active) { forage(); } } // end main Conclusion Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary. Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance.

"Even More ""Proving Rape"" Chatterbox feels that the Wall Street Journal editorial page's coverage of Juanita Broaddrick's rape charges against Bill Clinton (see ""Proving Rape ,"" ""More Proving Rape,"" as well as Michael Kinsley's ""Readme""column in the current issue) cries out for the introduction of the Scientific Method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility. With that in mind, Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the Intellectual Dishonesty (henceforth to be known as the Indis ) Index . Here's how it works: Publications that refuse to acknowledge (even if to refute the importance of) highly significant but inconvenient facts in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one point for the initial offense. They will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact--and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow-up without making note of said inconvenient fact. Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of Fame . Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness of Joseph Stalin. (Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase ""intellectual dishonesty,"" because it's pompous and falsely suggests that only intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest. But Chatterbox doesn't know any other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of offense.) For the purposes of this survey, the Wall Street Journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the Journal 's editorial page, because, in essence, it is. The Journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that Norma Kelsey, the friend and employee to Juanita Broaddrick who is one of two people partially corroborating Broaddrick's rape accusation, is the daughter of a man whose murderer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton. (A responsible account of the whole controversy in today's New York Times reports that Kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration.) The Journal editorial page gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial Op-Ed by Dorothy Rabinowitz on Feb. 19. Because it has published three times since the initial omission, it scores an additional three points. And because it published an editorial Feb. 22 taunting the rest of the press for not following it on the story--and still didn't mention the pardon--it scores an extra two points. That comes to a total of six . Chatterbox feels certain that the Journal editorial page will provide some follow-up tomorrow to tonight's NBC broadcast of its own Broaddrick interview, which means that if the Journal editorial page continues to take no action it will be in the Indis Hall of Fame by Monday at the latest! Chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding Rabinowitz bonus points for having ""eventually convinced"" Broaddrick to grant an interview to the New York Times (as the Times reports in today's story). But the Scientific Method does not permit any tinkering with the Indis Index 's scoring procedures. And besides, Rabinowitz's efforts on the Times ' behalf weren't really unethical, just puzzling, given the two newspapers' intense rivalry. When Chatterbox asked the Journal 's DC bureau chief, Alan Murray, who exercised good judgment in not breaking the Broaddrick story (and--full disclosure-- is Chatterbox's former boss), to comment about a Journal employee's feeding sources to the Times , he replied: ""I don't really have any comment on what the edit page did. They do their thing, we do ours."" Which is what Journal news employees are instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing embarrassment. For her part, Rabinowitz explains to Chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the Times were more indifferent than the Times made them sound. ""Ms. Broaddrick told me Sunday that a Times reporter had appeared at the house in the a.m., and that she had refused an interview,"" Rabinowitz writes in an e-mail message. ""I asked her why she had decided to talk to the New York Post 's Steve Dunleavy, and refused a Times reporter. She said Dunleavy caught her by surprise. She asked if I thought it would be all right to talk to the Times reporter. I told her it would be--certainly as all right as talking to Dunleavy. She said, 'Well, I'm sorry I didn't.' She said she would if he called again. I passed this on to [ Times reporter] Felicity Barringer during our second day's interview chat. So--that's how it happens that in the New York Times piece today I'm described--solemnly--as having 'eventually convinced' her to repeat the story to the New York Times."" --Timothy Noah",0
"Husbands and Wives Chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext (and hence much of the appeal) of a Hillary Clinton-Rudy Giuliani Senate race would be Wronged Wife vs. Neglectful Husband. By running against Giuliani (who has been reported in Vanity Fair to have a mistress--he denies it--and, by all accounts, has a sham marriage), the first lady could exact symbolic revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the Democratic party at the same time! That's almost enough for Chatterbox to jump on the Hillary for Senate bandwagon. The media conventional wisdom is that Giuliani would make Hillary Clinton's marital problems a major campaign issue. ""Giuliani makes Ken Starr look like a patsy,"" cried Time this week. But, er, wouldn't that be kind of a risky strategy, given his own problematic union? Many have already opined that the mayor is too vituperative, too much of a loner to practice the congenial, teamwork-oriented politics of the Senate; other doubters have pointed to his hardhearted, uncaring social policies. The last thing he needs is to draw more attention to these qualities in his personal life. Giuliani's estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover, is made clear in an interview with Hanover that appears in today's New York Times . Hanover ""would not say whether Giuliani would run for the Senate, whether she would like him to run for Senate, or whether she would campaign for him if he did. But she did say in the interview, which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's interest in the same New York Senate seat, that Mrs. Clinton is a 'very interesting' person. 'I think she's dynamic, and I think she's very smart, and she's an amazing speaker,' Ms. Hanover said."" And, for a punch line: ""Ms. Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said this week that Ms. Hanover had no comment on Mrs. Clinton's potential Senate campaign."" Does she have any comment on whether Ms. Hanover plans to be Hillary Clinton's campaign manager? Indis Index Update: NBC, in its Juanita Broaddrick broadcast last night, turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by Broaddrick in the late 1970s that Bill Clinton raped her. This diminishes-- slightly-- the significance of Norma Kelsey's possible motives in verifying parts of Broaddrick's story. (One of the three is Kelsey's sister, whose motives can be similarly questioned; the other two heard Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip, as only Kelsey and Broaddrick's husband claim to have.) However, Chatterbox notes that NBC, like every other responsible news organization that's covered this story, reported that Norma Kelsey's father's killer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton, and remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page won't. Its Indis Index is today up to seven. --Timothy Noah and Jodi Kantor",0
"The Entrepreneur Is the New Madonna Dear Joe, I know what you mean about being a journalist. Almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier. I often feel as if I only get half the story sometimes, so I typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than I will ever need. I think that is why I welcomed doing a book--it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism. Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories. Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public. Much of it, of course, using the standards of top newspapers, cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating, although it certainly could make for some very good stories. I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era (probably decades and decades hence as it is too close). In any case, there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons. I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur. So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch. The smart-boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully. I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man--at AOL, for example, there was a conscious effort to develop other ""characters,"" for lack of a better word. So there, while you think of Case, you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives. Steve Ballmer, of course, is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft, but it still seems to be Bill's show over there. While I did not attend the trial--I was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches, several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing--it certainly seemed as if the image of Bill Gates took a beating and the insular culture of Microsoft did not look so good. That's ironic, since I think it was just that insularity that helped them, much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley. AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here, I am sure, since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati. Out in the D.C. area, they looked positively exciting next to all the government-oriented contractors. I wonder if that means geography is destiny, and it's still location, location, location. From where I am sitting, I think the Microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age. I think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it's clear that the balance of power is shifting again, although it not clear where it will land. Will the strongman of the era be AOL, AT&T, Microsoft, or one of the big media companies? Or will it be none of them because the Internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate? I always use two simple words when people tell me that one company--whether it is AOL or Microsoft or Disney--is in charge of all our destinies: Babylon was. That incredible empire dominated the world and I imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire's grip on humanity. But we all know how that story turned out. Now I am getting way too philosophical, but this is my final missive, so why not? Perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going. As for me, I'll stick with my philosophy of reporting and, I guess, life--nobody knows. Cheers, Kara",0
"No More Kisses In light of Secretary of State Albright's imminent trip to the middle east, the New York Times , Los Angeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situation there. But USA Today stays with Princess Di. The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday, she will ""read the riot act"" to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism. Her goal will be to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel, telling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting Hamas, and ""no more kisses"" of its leaders. The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context. Given that the troubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and Israel, but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the paper states that the U.S. is now facing the prospect that the moderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and Iran is falling apart. The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon, dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was ambushed, with twelve deaths the result. Perhaps the most striking indicator of a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that cabinet member Ariel Sharon, who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel entrenched in Lebanon in the first place, is among those urging a reconsideration of the deployment. Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its controlling stake of Compuserve, but it's the Post with the news that AOL is set to take it over. The Wall Street Journal ""Outlook"" observes, ""In the U.S. job market, the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers,"" and states that ""the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of corporate downsizing,"" which left behind survivors who took stock of career options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land better offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries. This has led, says the Journal , to annual compensation rising 5-6 percent a year. Much of the continuing Diana coverage is spinning off into the realm of meta- and meta-meta-pieces. The LAT , for instance, examines what it takes to be a new ""cuddly-feely"" Britain born of the national grief experience. But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as well. Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill ambassador job shortly before her death, and USAT reports that Le Figaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family and children. Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story. ""Not everyone in Calcutta, or India for that matter, is unanimous in praising the nun, whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this collapsing city's poor neighborhoods. Salvation--hers and that of the destitute she rescued from the gutters--was her aim, not economic or social development as many others understand it, she said."" It's odd, however, that in repeating this charge, the Times didn't interview the man most closely associated with it, Christopher Hitchens, or refer to the book where he set it out, The Missionary Position . Hmmm, wanna bet there was a copy of the book on somebody's desk at the Times though? What's with the top-of-the-front headline the LAT puts over its picture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her at the U.S. Open--""Venus Brought Back to Earth""? Doesn't that sound like celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory? How odd--and a good illustration of how trying to shoe-horn in a ""witty"" headline can drive you into an idea that doesn't fit or is undeserved. Given that Ms. Williams' parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still pretty-lilly-white sport, don't be surprised if there's a bit of a complaint about this.",0
"Fashioning Paula USA Today leads with Texas' settlement of its product-liability lawsuit against the leading tobacco companies. The top nonlocal story at the Washington Post is the latest development in the Indonesian economic crisis--a rare and boosterish Suharto press conference in contrast to a further plunging stock market and food riots in outlying towns. The New York Times leads with a comprehensive poll about American attitudes concerning abortion. In the Texas case, reports USAT , the defendant companies have agreed to pay about $15 billion over 25 years to reimburse the state for expenses it incurred in the treatment of smoking-related illnesses. That makes Texas the third state to settle such a case, joining Florida and Mississippi. There are, says the paper, a total of 40 such suits on file, with Minnesota's turn coming next week. The Wall Street Journal states that the plaintiffs' lawyers hired by Texas to try the case will receive as part of the deal almost $2.2 billion in fees. The NYT abortion survey, the first conducted by the paper since 1989, was based on telephone interviews of 1,101 people and detects ""a notable shift from general acceptance"" of having the procedure: from 40 percent to 32 percent. And the pollsters also detected an increasingly acute sensitivity to abortion timing: Sixty-one percent of those polled thought abortions should be permitted during the first trimester, but only 15 percent in the second and just 7 percent in the third. (The piece notes that this last stat helps explain why a focus on partial-birth abortions has proven politically advantageous for abortion foes.) Nearly 45 percent of those asked to state the present law on abortion could not give the correct answer. The WSJ notes that the just-concluded football/TV deal will probably mean even steeper cable bills in the near future. Some local cable companies, the paper says, expect the fees they'll pay ESPN to go up more than 20 percent. And they're in the habit of passing expenses along to Joe Remote. Even nonsports fans will be affected, notes the Journal , because ESPN is usually part of basic cable service. (Which raises the question: Hasn't technology progressed to a point that would allow cafeteria-style programming choices by subscribers?) A scan of the headlines found cheek-by-jowl on the WP 's Page A6 provides an interesting snapshot of the life of the modern Cabinet officer: ""[Ex-HUD Secretary] Cisneros's Ex-Mistress Pleads Guilty,"" ""[Labor Secretary] Herman Denies Allegations of Influence-Selling Scheme,"" and ""Two Tyson Foods Executive Indicted Over Gifts to [Ex-Agriculture Secretary] Espy."" The WSJ reports that, according to an MIT survey, Americans are twice as likely to back a tax increase going toward the search for extraterrestrials than one for gene-cloning research. The NYT reports that today's issue of the journal Science will describe an experiment in which people's biological clocks were reset three hours by shining a bright light on the back of their knees. The finding, if it holds up, says the Times , may lead to a simple way for airline travelers to fight jet lag. Yesterday's Los Angeles Times ran a story under the headline ""Paula Jones Works on Her Court Appearance,"" which, illustrated by pictures of Jones, was all about the various looks she's had since stepping on the public stage. The piece concluded that she's finally graduated to an image that's ""sophisticated yet soft."" Today's WP ""Style"" section (that's the opposite of substance, remember) picks up that ball and runs with it, with a lengthy discourse on the new PJ. ""It is,"" hyperventilates the Post , one of the most jaw-dropping public make-overs ever."" Jones apparently has ""smoothed the frizzy mane of curls that once reached to such dazzling heights. Her makeup is now subtle and based on natural, not neon, hues. Her clothing is inspired by the boardroom instead of the secretarial pool. She has embraced the markers of dignity, refinement and power."" In true newspaper overkill fashion, the piece backs this up by consulting Cynde Watson, national makeup artist for Bobbi Brown Essentials, and Steven Zdatny, a historian at West Virginia University specializing in the aesthetics and politics of hair. The placement of these two pieces is a PR triumph, but one carrying the seeds of its own destruction: If people know all this work is going into making Paula Jones seem a certain someone, doesn't that just make it obvious that she's really somebody else?",0
"Stephanopoulos Analyzes His Own Crime There was former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week this morning, furrow-browed and ""heartbroken with all the evidence coming out"" against the president. Last week, when the Lewinsky story was only a few hours old, Stephanopoulos popped up on Good Morning America to demonstrate his concern. ""These are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the president. There's no question that, if they're true, they ... could lead to impeachment proceedings."" Is Chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about Stephanopoulos' eager show of independence from the president? The problem isn't so much his disloyalty. Political figures turn on each other from time to time, for good and bad reasons; we're used to it. Stephanopoulos wants to run for the Senate and doesn't want to seem a Clinton stooge. By lending credence to the Lewinsky charges, and treating Clinton's familiar defenses as the lies and half-lies they seem to be, Stephanopoulos shows he's not a fool. The trouble is that Stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place. During the 1992 campaign, when Gennifer Flowers first brought Clinton's philandering to public attention, Stephanopoulos--as Clinton's chief spinner, distracter, and all-around bullshit artist--played a crucial role in discrediting Flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth, namely that Clinton had a disturbing zipper problem. (Don't say Stephanopoulos didn't know. Again, he's not a fool.) Simply put, Stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments. The 1993 documentary The War Room captures some of his efforts on tape. Early in the film, with the Flowers crisis in full bloom, Sam Donaldson interviews Stephanopoulos, who blames it all on the ""Republican attack machine."" ""Gov. Clinton has no character problem,"" Stephanopoulos declares. Donaldson suggests that on 60 Minutes Clinton had admitted to infidelity. ""He said he had problems in his marriage,"" says Stephanopoulos, correcting Donaldson's deviation from the pre-scripted fudge-phrase of the day. (Today, of course, the president's defenders claim that Clinton admitted infidelity on 60 Minutes and that the fully informed voters simply didn't care.) Near the end of The War Room, Stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of Clinton paramours, which he is about to publicize. Stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet. ""You would be laughed at ..."" he tells the caller. ""I guarantee you that if you do this you'll never work in Democratic politics again. ... Nobody will believe you and people will think you're scum."" You might say that Stephanopoulos helped invent the philander-protection techniques that seem to have made Clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught. He was one of Clinton's principal enablers, to use a word employed by Maureen Dowd in today's New York Times . When Democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of Clinton, they don't need to look much further than the Big Lie about philandering that Stephanopoulos, Carville (and a cooperative campaign press corps) helped to put over in 1992. Now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and ABC News analyst. It's as if Roy Cohn went on television in the mid-'50s to soberly rue the damage wreaked by Sen. Joe McCarthy, without any apology for his own role. Much has been made of the way famous wrongdoers (e.g.: Dick Morris, Marv Albert) rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture. But usually at least a nanosecond of contrition is required. Stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the country. If Clinton, as is now increasingly clear, was a time bomb waiting to explode, then Stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the White House and muffled the ticking.",0
"Selling Land to Jews Last week, a 70-year-old Palestinian real-estate dealer was murdered after he violated a new edict by the Palestinian Authority making the sale of Arab-owned land to Jews a capital crime. The issue of land sales has a long history as a subtheme of the Jewish-Arab struggle. The 19 th century Jewish intellectuals who conceived of Zionism --the idea that Jewish survival depends on the establishment of a Jewish state in the biblical land of Israel--never worked out their ideology's logistics. Jewish settlement in Palestine, then part of the decaying Ottoman Empire, only proceeded piecemeal. In the 1880s and 1890s, about 25,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. Most integrated into multiethnic communities in the cities of Jaffa, Tiberias, and Jerusalem. A second wave of 30,000 immigrants came between 1905 and 1914, many of whom were Labor Zionists who wanted the Jewish state to be socialist. Extolling the virtues of manual labor, they acquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee Syrian and Lebanese landlords. The ""New Palestinian Jew ,"" they said, needed to be physically tougher than the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in Europe. The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1904 for the purpose of buying up land from Arabs. After the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I, Britain acquired Palestine and promised (in the Balfour Declaration) the creation of a Jewish state. In anticipation, Jews in Palestine began laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity. The Jewish National Fund's charter was amended to mandate that Jewish land could never be resold to Arabs or opened to non-Jewish employees. Following Jewish National Fund guidelines, farmers evicted Palestinian peasants living on the newly acquired plots. The total number displaced was small. By 1946, Jews owned only 7 percent of Palestine, but the perceived threat of displacement was widespread among Arabs. Starting around 1910, Arab newspapers railed against Jewish land acquisition. Among the peasantry, rumors spread alleging an Anglo-Jewish conspiracy to remove Muslims from Palestine. Anxious to avoid being blamed for Palestinian landlessness, British officials began imposing token restrictions on Jewish land purchase in 1940. They publicly supported Arab complaints that Jews were driving Arabs off the land. Palestinians say evictions destroyed their way of life, forcing them to move from rural Palestine to crowded cities in search of work. They also say that the better-educated Jewish buyers had duped illiterate peasants into selling property. The Arab National Fund, created in 1931 by wealthy Arab families to purchase land for displaced peasants, was ineffective. During the 1930s, Palestinian responses turned violent . In 1934 Jerusalem's mufti, the spiritual leader of the city's Muslims, decreed that believers were duty bound to murder other Muslims who sold land to Jews. Arabs, who outnumbered Jews by more than 2-to-1, revolted against Jewish land acquisition and British promises of Jewish nationhood. About 5,000 Arabs and several hundred Jews were killed in riots and guerrilla attacks between 1936 and 1939. Zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all the territory's residents. Jewish immigrants introduced modern agricultural technology , which increased productivity and helped fill the markets with food to feed the growing Arab population. Zionists also maintain that Jews became a lucrative market for Arab-manufactured goods. Some historians trace Palestinian landlessness to Palestine's entry into the world economy in the 1880s. Urban commerce drew some peasants from their family farms. Other subsistence farmers found themselves competing with cash-crop entrepreneurs (Jews and Arabs) whose successes changed the face of Palestinian agriculture. Jewish land purchases were not the primary factor, these historians say. Very little of the land owned today by individual Jews and the Israeli government was acquired by purchase. Jewish sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are: by war. Israel confiscated all land owned by the British government, mostly desert and mountains, after the 1948 War of Independence . Property owned by Arab refugees, who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the Israeli army (another long-standing controversy), was also taken over by individual Jews or confiscated by the government. Many Palestinians, however, stayed put, retained their land, and became Israeli citizens. A new school of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by Jewish land acquisition, and concludes that it was not always fair. One popular theory compares Zionism's imperative to acquire land to the American idea of Manifest Destiny (that it was the United States' God-given right to rule from coast to coast). Others argue that it was a mistake for the Jewish National Fund to prohibit non-Jewish laborers from the newly purchased lands. However, even these revisionists agree that the Jews had not intended to evict Muslims from Palestine. Israeli security officials believed that the murdered real-estate dealer was executed by plainclothes Palestinian Authority police. The Palestinian Authority's decision to make the sale of land to Jews a capital crime reflects Palestinian frustration with Israeli land use, specifically the creation of a new Jewish neighborhood now under construction in East Jerusalem. In the past, death threats have done little to deter sales of land. According to British land records, the Jerusalem mufti's 1934 decree failed to prevent sales. But that decree did not have the power of civil law behind it. Nevertheless, the incentives to sell at the market price are substantial, and if the threats create new scarcities, higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unload their land.",0
"Fetal Viability ""Viability"" has become the focus of the abortion debate. Last week, the Senate rejected Majority Leader Tom Daschle's bill banning the abortion of ""viable fetuses."" But William Bennett and William Safire hailed Daschle's bill as the great compromise that might settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion. Forty-one states already restrict the abortion of viable fetuses. What is a viable fetus? How is the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of abortion? Roe vs. Wade , the 1973 case legalizing abortion, made fetal viability an important legal concept . The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot put the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the fetus is ""viable."" The court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged life outside the mother's womb. It said this included fetuses that doctors expected to be sustained by respirators. The court accepted the conventional medical wisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of a pregnancy, the third trimester, sometime between the 24 th and 28 th week (a pregnancy usually lasts 38 weeks). Because the point of viability varies, the court ruled, it could only be determined case by case and by the woman's own doctor. Even if the fetus is viable, the court said, states could not outlaw an abortion if the woman's life or health was at stake. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued in a 1983 decision that Roe was on a ""collision course with itself."" She said that improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy, allowing states greater opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion. And this seems to be the case--up to a point. Doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the 23 rd week--a week earlier than was thought 24 years ago. Most hospitals will only perform abortions through the 22 nd week of pregnancy. But no baby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the 22 nd week. Babies delivered during the 22 nd and 23 rd weeks weigh just over a pound. Their lungs have barely formed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale. Circulation depends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones. A baby born during the 22 nd week has a 14.8 percent chance of survival. And about half of these survivors are brain-damaged, either by lack of oxygen (from poor initial respiration) or too much oxygen (from the ventilator). Neonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the 22 nd week, because before then the lungs are not fully formed. Probability of survival increases for babies born later in pregnancy: 25 percent in the 23 rd week, 42 percent in the 24 th week, 57 percent in 25 th week. By the 30 th week, when a newborn doesn't require a ventilator to breathe, it has a 90 percent chance of survival. And only after the 30 th week do the risks of long-term brain damage begin to substantially subside. Because premature babies depend on technology, survival rates vary based on access to that technology . For instance, in rural communities, which commonly lack expensive infant intensive-care units, survival rates in these early weeks are much lower. Doctors assess a fetus's viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs have formed. Sonograms allow doctors to estimate the fetus's weight, which correlates with the lungs' development, and to look for signs--such as the development of functioning eyelids and creases in the skin--that coincide with the onset of a functioning respiratory system. None of the methods for predicting viability are very precise. Despite important Supreme Court decisions since 1973 modifying the doctrine of Roe , the court's thinking about fetal viability has remained fairly constant . The only significant revision came in the Casey decision (1992), which made viability even more important. The court said that state laws could require a woman and her doctor to perform tests to prove that a fetus is not viable before she obtains an abortion. Forty-one states now have laws restricting post-viability abortions. Some allow doctors to decide for themselves if the fetus is viable. Some require doctors to perform tests to prove a fetus is pre-viable and require multiple doctors to certify the findings. Eleven states have banned the procedure called intact dilation and extraction (IDE)--also known as partial-birth abortion --in the belief that this procedure is used mainly post-viability. Banning IDEs nationwide is a major goal of the pro-life movement. Movement adherents claim that the IDE procedure--in which delivery is induced, the fetus's skull is crushed, and its brains are suctioned--amounts to infanticide. Barring this procedure is also the only regulation of abortion that public-opinion polls say has a majority of support. Pro-choicers say the ban on IDEs is inconsistent with Roe , because the procedure can be used to abort pre-viable fetuses. Some medical ethicists and constitutional scholars say that the Supreme Court was wrong to create the pre-viability/post-viability distinction in the first place. Why, they ask, does the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vast medical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortion debate: the fetus's own claim to ""human-ness"" and a woman's right to control her body? Even if viability is an important moral line, is it drawn in the right place? Keeping alive a baby born in the 22 nd week costs several hundred thousand dollars and usually fails, regardless of the effort. The fuss over post-viability abortions ultimately concerns only a very small number of procedures . Less than one percent of all abortions performed take place after the 21 st week. In 1992, only 1,070 abortions were performed after the 25 th week.",0
"A defense of Michael Moore and ""Bowling for Columbine"" (Op-Ed)By Eloquence Wed Aug 13th, 2003 at 09:00:09 AM EST This is an open letter to David Hardy, author of Bowling for Columbine: Documentary or Fiction?, probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the Oscar-winning documentary. Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award. Their chances are small, however, as their arguments rely on polemic, exaggeration and misrepresentation -- in other words, on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using. Dear David Hardy, It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary. In a time of simple-minded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr. Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative ""grass-roots"" propaganda. Not surprisingly, much of the criticism of Moore's film is misguided or outright wrong, often vastly more inaccurate than Moore's work itself. Moore portrays the NRA as an unethical, dishonest organization; he sees the paranoia and fear in the United States as a primary cause of violence, and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem. His documentary is full of subtle humor, jaw-dropping dialogue and dark contrasts. All in all, it is an accurate portrayal of America's gun and violence culture. It also raises questions about America's foreign policy of recent decades, questions which have been all but ignored by Moore's critics. On your webpage, you state that ""Moore's resolution is questionable. After all, early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence -- because Canadians like, and Japanese positively love, those. If violent movies and violent videogames cannot cause violence -- then how can newscasts about violence do so?"" This is a faulty generalization. If, as Moore implies (although never states as fact), video games and violent movies are relatively harmless, it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless. There is a huge difference, for example, between playing a game like ""Quake"" and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now. The latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, which killed 800,000 people. Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved. Obviously, media propaganda can incite people to kill. Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven. Moore's hypothesis (which apparently comes at least in part from the book ""Culture of Fear"" by Barry Glassner, also advertised on Moore's website) is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia, which itself can lead to violent acts. This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence. It is no surprise, however, that US (and European) media do not question their own propaganda of fear. Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists. Children who grow up in war-torn regions are known for having similar views -- war is perceived as a normal part of existence, violence as a natural way to solve disputes. In a weaker sense, the same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how ""the enemies of freedom"" are punished. Moore's film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV. Americans were gloating over this demented corpse show: ""They squealed like little piggies too, so you'll have to make do with 'oink, oink, squeeeeeeeallll' for their last words. That goes for your grandson Mustafa too, by the way. Still think fucking with the U.S. was a good idea, Sammy?"" Mustafa was 14 years when he was killed. Americans cheer the killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations. It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moore's film seeks to address. Inaccuracies Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore's movies. It is true that Moore's film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive, but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme. It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades. Let's look at some specific criticisms: 1) The bank scene, listed on your website on a separate page. Critics have stated that this scene was ""staged"", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time. It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been ""normally"" picked up at another dealer. It is not explained what ""normally"" is supposed to mean, but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film. This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore. The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe. According to the same WSJ interview, ""Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period."" This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed. Moore's detractors have sometimes extended those 7-10 days to several weeks, contradicting the bank's own estimate. There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene. The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account. The silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation: a bank handing out guns to its customers, higlighting the utter laxness of how Americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious. 2) The Lockheed-Martin interview. This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate. First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly. The dialogue goes as follows: Moore: ""So you don't think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to the factory every day - he builds missiles. These are weapons of mass destruction. What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?"" McCollum (PR person): ""I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us."" First, note the word ""our"" in Moore's question. Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question. McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized. However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant. Even Lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible. In response to one Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: ""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited."" Of course, critics have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military, and that the company is the nation's largest military contractor. As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults. Yes, Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant -- but he makes no incorrect statement. It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims. 3) Denver NRA meeting. Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards. First, the ""from my cold, dead hands"" part: This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston. It is perhaps one of his most famous quotes, shown on national TV even here in Germany. It tells viewers: Aha, this is the person we are talking about. Nowhere does Moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in Denver, and in fact, their reptition later in the movie at another occasion (oddly claimed by critics to be again ""misattributed"") is simply a reminder of this. It is Moore's way to say: Viewers, meet Charlton Heston, gun nut extraordinaire. The ""visual of a billboard and a narration"" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver. Moore is a professional filmmaker -- he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites, and to accomplish that effect, uses subtle interludes instead of long-winded introductions. This is a common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is ""distorting"" the interview. What he does is standard filmmaking practice. The same goes for the interview which follows. Moore's critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety, have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of ""balance"". The NRA was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so. They were right. You claim that there was ""no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to the members, and there were upwards of 4,000,000 members."" 10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date, had the NRA really wanted to. It is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money, not to piss off the victims of Colubmine. That does not change the fact that they did just that. Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff. This is what good documentary filmmaking is about. And here the critics again ignore important evidence: When Heston mentions the mayor of Denver, the crowd boos loudly. Heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayor's letter (only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request -- not mentioning at all the reasons you have given!). This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said ""Fuck you"". To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics. 4) The Kayla Rolland case. Again, critics like yourself charge Moore with deception. The rally took place on October 17, the shooting on February 29. Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: ""Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas. It is brilliantly, if unethically, done."" As noted above, the ""from my cold dead hands"" part is simply Moore's way to introduce Heston. Did anyone but Moore's critics view it as anything else? He certainly does not ""attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered"" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is. Concerning the Georgetown Hoya interview where Heston was asked about Rolland, you write: ""There is no indication that [Heston] recognized Kayla Rolland's case."" This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence. Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview, he certainly knew about the case at that point. Regarding the NRA website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase ""48 hours after Kayla Rolland is pronounced dead"": This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing. The reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that Heston hurried to Flint to immediately hold a rally there (as will become quite obvious), but simply to highlight the first mention of the name ""Kayla Rolland"" in the text, which is in this paragraph. Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: a) Moore clearly states that ""before he came to Flint"", Heston gave an interview. In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? b) Why should Moore leave the words ""Clinton is on the Today Show"" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part? I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing. c) Both the ""soccer mom"" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact. The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that ""we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland"". You make the hysterical claim that the interview ""may be faked"" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death? Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out? This makes no sense. Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of ""Bowling"" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston. The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as ""Hanlon's Razor"" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly. Had they done so, Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe. In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is ""full of lies"". 5) You write: ""Having created the desired impression, Moore follows with his Heston interview."" No, he doesn't. You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself. The Heston interview is at the very end of the movie. After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of ""people from all over America"", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating. These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their ""rights"" and to look for quick, simple answers -- as Busch states, gun owners wanted to ""hang [the child] from the highest tree"". This is all not mentioned by critics of Moore's movie, who claim to be objective. Perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moore's film is your sub-essay ""Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked?"" Moore answers a simple question -- how could the scene have been filmed -- with a simple answer: two cameras. From this, you construct an obscure conspiracy of ""re-enactment"": ""For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted 'Hey!' to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left."" Even if your ""re-enactment"" theory is true (and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion), this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview. You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader, without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion. 6)Animated history of the US. Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film. But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote ""gun rights"" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish. Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people? I highly doubt it. But if they didn't, one of their functions was to continue the racism of the KKK. This is the key message of this part of the animation, which is again being ignored by its critics. 7) Buell shooting in Flint. You write: ""Fact: The little boy was the class thug, already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil, and had fought with Kayla the day before"". This characterization of a six-year-old as a pencil-stabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that Moore's film warns against. It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset. The kid was a little bastard, and the parents were involved in drugs -- case closed. But why do people deal with drugs? Because it's so much fun to do so? It is by now well documented that the CIA tolerated crack sales in US cities to fund the operation of South American ""contras"" It is equally well known that the so-called ""war on drugs"" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population (both in relative and absolute numbers). In poor areas, the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort. But the real cause here are not the drugs themselves, but poverty and the ""war on drugs"". Had the boy's mother not been shipped to a ""welfare to work"" program, she might at least have had some time to spend with her son. Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother/child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities, the awareness of the consequences of one's actions, and the learning of conflict resolution by non-violent means. Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program, knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring. Once again, your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moore's (and Busch's) assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes. That's because while there is a so-called war on drugs, there is no war on poverty. Poverty is frequently portrayed as natural, and the poor in America are seen by conservatives as VCR-owners who are just too lazy to work. In reality, what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen, to the detriment of families. It is notable that the Wall Street Journal's reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours: It called Moore's claim ""preposterous"". How could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens? 8) Taliban and American aid. After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour. Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001. Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies. Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage. Never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal. Never mind that this is all documented on Michael Moore's website about the film. 9) Gun homicides. Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer. That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries. His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data, his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources (and, as you correctly point out, he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries). A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website. Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology. The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: Japan: 0.02 per 100,000 (1994)England/Wales: 0.11 per 100,000 (1997)Germany: 0.22 per 100,000 (1994)Australia: 0.44 per 100,000 (1994)United States: 3.72 per 100,000 (1999) Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make -- concluding that gun ownership ""leads"" to violence. In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited. It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence -- but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly. It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John ""Mary"" Lott. The gun control movement, on the other hand, distracts from the real causes of violence -- poverty, paranoia, the ""war on drugs"" and antisexuality. If these causes were addressed, gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem (but also unnecessary); just like it is in Switzerland. 10) Canada ammunition purchase. You write: Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart. He asks us to ""look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart."" He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised. ""That's right. I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada. Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal. Once again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and ""faking"" (a word which ""Canadian officials"" have never used; for such a distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics). If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson, there is nothing fraudulent about that. He made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification. His claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim. 11) Heston's allegedly implied racism. You conclude from Heston's own words that Heston was somehow portrayed as racist. If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with ""having a more mixed ethnicity"". Heston's answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful. While this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition, if he is unable to defend the interests of the NRA, he should not be their spokesman. In this case, Hanlon's Razor can be applied to Heston -- he is probably not racist, but incompetent. Your accusations of inappropriate cutting are once again entirely unsupported -- in fact, it is quite clear from watching that particular scene that there is not a single cut from the point at which Moore asks Heston a second time for the cause of the higher violence in the States, and the point when he mentions the Kayla Rolland incident. If Heston makes himself look like a fool, that should hardly be blamed on Michael Moore. Conclusion You write: ""Bowling for Columbine is dishonest. It is fraudulent. To trash Heston, it even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewer's mind to a wrong conclusion."" None of this is true. What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries, one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture. It is not a flawless diamond -- the ""48 hours"" scene in particular suffers from bad editing, the statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves. Other than towards the NRA, the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and comes up with some thoughtful answers. The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics. Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film, he would have used other material: photos from America's Emergency Rooms. Certainly, Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar. The shrill (and remarkably unsuccessful) Internet campaign to ""revoke"" his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the film's accuracy. It is not only the highest grossing non-music documentary of all time, among the users of the largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also the highest rated one. According to the LA Times, the documentary genre ""owes a huge debt to Michael Moore"" -- after Bowling's success, films like ""Spellbound"" and ""Capturing the Friedmans"" were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely. But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason. His next project has the working title ""Fahrenheit 9/11: The temperature at which freedom burns"", and he intends to launch it shortly before the next US presidential election. It is unlikely, however, that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact. After all, the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record-holding documentary: ""Roger & Me"" by Michael Moore. Yours sincerely, Erik M��ller This text is in the public domain.",0
"Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (I) Drew F. Nobile University of Washington Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók, one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used. Bartók’s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure. This remains true even with one of his last compositions, the Concerto for Orchestra, written two years before his death in 1943. The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement. The analysis will treat the movement tonally, investigating the progression of local “tonics” and its relationship to the overall form. We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common-practice compositional techniques. Harmonic Structure and Form Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form.” Bartók, 431. While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order. The “backwards” recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates. For example, the fifth string quartet. Also see Bartók’s comments on that (Bartók, 414). Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction. As the example shows, the development section is divided into three subsections; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group, and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition. Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric. Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different. See Wilson, 168-170. || Intro | FTG | STG | Dev I (FTG) | Dev II (new) | Dev III (FTG) | STG | FTG || The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively. example 1: formal structure of the first movement Sonata form—or, “more-or-less” sonata form—carries harmonic as well as formal connotations. While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure. To begin with, the movement is in F. When we say “in F,” we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)—the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement. Using this interpretation, we can map out the local tonics (tonal centers) used throughout the movement, as shown in Example 2. example 2: harmonic structure of the first movement In this example, the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece (Introduction–Exposition–Development­–Recapitulation)—so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins. Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg. The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition. Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet. See Bartók, 414-415. In this particular movement, Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections. Paul Wilson gives a detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis; we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his findings. Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure. The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper. The Introduction As Paul Wilson points out, the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures. Wilson, 172. The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece. To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center. The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale. Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself. The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive. Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set. example 3: measures 1-6 (celli and basses) example 4: measures 12-16 (celli and basses) example 5: measures 22-29 (celli, basses and violas) Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths. Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths. If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example. Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯. The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭. As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F. So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth. We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth. This motion is exemplified in Example 2 in the second theme group (mm. 155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2. Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples. This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8. So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole. The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor. This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor. The concluding motive of this section in the violins (the bracketed sections of Example 6), as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff. (Example 7), are related to the first head motive of the first theme, which is shown in the first measure of Example 8. All three of these motives span a tritone, which as mentioned is the “dominant” relationship in this movement. Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,” Wilson, 173. but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition. example 6: measures 56-58 (violin 1) example 7: measure 58 (violas, celli, basses); repeated through measure 75 The Exposition Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears. The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over. As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures. While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter, the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation. Rather, this motive is a small-scale representation of the tonic-dominant relationship of tritone partners, specifically F and B, that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement. example 8: measures 76-80 (violins) Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings. Example 9 reproduces the chords, and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern. As Example 10 shows, the chords are more-or-less in duple meter (4/8 and 2/8) with one “hiccup” occurring in the 5/8 measure. This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2/8 measures). As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation. example 9: measures 77-91 (bassoons, horns, lower strings; reduced) example 10: measures 77-91 rebarred to reflect rhythmic pattern We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77. While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76-94, these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F. E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131. Measures 95-130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭, where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass. Example 11 illustrates this structure. Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass, C♯ (D♭) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme. The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here. Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth. This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯-C♯-B-E (with the addition of some passing tones), in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths. example 11: bass structure of the first theme group, measures 76-155 example 12: measures 134-141 (trombone) Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition. Wilson, 174. While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context. E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all. The passage from measures 85-89 is centered on E♭ (and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step), but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function. Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2. In measures 91-95, the bass descends F-E♭-D♭-C, which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant. However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the “true” dominant. The descent in measures 91-95 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on C, which makes the eventual reinterpretation of C and descent to B stronger. This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge. The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple, which is in stark contrast to the first theme. B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it. Measures 192-197 are in E♭, with the bass notes in the harp, and measures 198-209 are in D♭. A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth. The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209. Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged. Paul Wilson points out that “[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.” Wilson, 179. In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant. The Development As mentioned, the development is divided into three subsections. In Example 2, the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches, and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal center—none of these pitches is involved in the structural whole-tone descent. As Paul Wilson states, the development “is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise. Wilson, 180. The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements, is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development. Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],” Wilson, 182. there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed. Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme. The first section of the development, measures 231-271, begins with a big D-minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section. Although it moves to E♭ minor in measure 239, it returns to D minor in measure 248, which suggests that E♭ is an upper neighbor prolonging D. The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the “theme” of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme. This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section. While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive. example 13: measures 248-264 (violins) The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭). This section is reproduced as Example 14. This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section. Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303. The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯. Because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to B in the second theme group, we could conceive of C# as a sub-dominant in this movement. As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms. example 15: measures 231-232 (violins and trumpets) example 14: measures 272-313 (reduction): development, part 2 The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17. The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16). As previously mentioned, the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme. The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B♭-E♭-A♭-D♭; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set. The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center). example 16: measures 316-318: establishment of b♭ The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C. The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363. The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation. Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section. example 17: measures 316-340 (brass): fugato section example 18: measures 342-349 (horns): inverted fugato subject The Recapitulation The recapitulation, as we have seen, presents the themes in reverse order. The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified. It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole-step by the intervening fourth. The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G. Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467. E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme (measures 456-487) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme. The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences. Firstly, its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it; the first chord in Example 9 is an F-minor triad, and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F-minor scale. In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody. In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation. In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes. In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement. Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout. There are also no phrase divisions—the music simply drives forward with no pause until measure 514, where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious V-I cadence, signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes. example 19: measures 488-494: the first theme in the recapitulation There is no fine line between music that is “tonal” and music that is “atonal.” Bartók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality. While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work. Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum. But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results. To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra. By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm, we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions. It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why. References Antokoletz, Elliot.

"So I guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date, Johno. This is what, uh, This is a meeting for me. um, Eva, Bhaskara, and I did. Did you add more stuff to it? later? Um. Why? Um. I don't know. There were, like, the - you know, and all that stuff. But. I thought you - you said you were adding stuff but I don't know. Uh, no. This is - Um, Ha! Very nice. Um, so we thought that, We can write up uh, an element, and - for each of the situation nodes that we observed in the Bayes-net? So. What's the situation like at the entity that is mentioned? if we know anything about it? Is it under construction? Or is it on fire or something happening to it? Or is it stable? and so forth, going all the way um, f- through Parking, Location, Hotel, Car, Restroom, Riots, Fairs, Strikes, or Disasters. So is - This is - A situation are - is all the things which can be happening right now? Or, what is the situation type? That's basically just specifying the - the input for the - w- what's Oh, I see y- Why are you specifying it in X_M_L? Um. Just because it forces us to be specific about the values here? O_K. And, also, I mean, this is a - what the input is going to be. Right? So, we will, uh - This is a schema. This is - Well, yeah. I just don't know if this is th- l- what the - Does - This is what Java Bayes takes? as a No, because I mean if we - Bayes-net spec? I mean we're sure gonna interface to - We're gonna get an X_M_L document from somewhere. Right? And that X_M_L document will say ""We are able to - We were able to observe that w- the element, um, of the Location that the car is near. "" So that's gonna be - Um. So this is the situational context, everything in it. Is that what Situation is short for, shi- situational context? Yep. O_K. So this is just, again, a- an X_M_L schemata which defines a set of possible, uh, permissible X_M_L structures, which we view as input into the Bayes-net. Right? And then we can r- uh possibly run one of them uh transformations? That put it into the format that the Bayes n- or Java Bayes or whatever wants? Yea- Are you talking - are you talking about the - the structure? Well it - I mean when you observe a node. When you - when you say the input to the v- Java Bayes, Um-hmm. it takes a certain format, right? Which I don't think is this. Although I don't know. No, it's certainly not this. Nuh. So you could just - Couldn't you just run a - X_S_L . Yeah. Yeah. To convert it into the Java Bayes for- format? Yep. O_K. That's - That's no problem, but I even think that, um - I mean, once - Once you have this sort of as - running as a module - Right? What you want is - You wanna say, ""O_K, give me the posterior probabilities of the Go-there node, when this is happening."" Right? When the person said this, the car is there, it's raining, and this is happening. And with this you can specify the - what's happening in the situation, and what's happening with the user. So we get - After we are done, through the Situation we get the User Vector. So, this is a - So this is just a specification of all the possible inputs? Yep. And, all the possible outputs, too. O_K. So, we have, um, for example, the, uh, Go-there decision node which has two elements, going-there and its posterior probability, and not-going-there and its posterior probability, because the output is always gonna be all the decision nodes and all the - the - a- all the posterior probabilities for all the values. And then we would just look at the, eh, Struct that we wanna look at in terms of if - if we're only asking about one of the - So like, if I'm just interested in the going-there node, I would just pull that information out of the Struct that gets return- that would - that Java Bayes would output? Um, pretty much, yes, but I think it's a little bit more complex. As, if I understand it correctly, it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes. So, when we input something, we always get the, uh, posterior probabilities for all of these. Right? O_K. So there is no way of telling it t- not to tell us about the EVA values. Yeah, wait I agree, that's - yeah, use - oh, uh Yeah, O_K. So - so we get this whole list of - of, um, things, and the question is what to do with it, what to hand on, how to interpret it, in a sense. So y- you said if you - ""I'm only interested in whether he wants to go there or not"", then I just look at that node, look which one - Look at that Struct in the output, right? Yep. Look at that Struct in the - the output, even though I wouldn't call it a ""Struct"". But. Well i- well, it's an X_M_L Structure that's being res- returned, right? Oh. Mm-hmm. So every part of a structure is a ""Struct"". Yeah. Yeah, I just uh - I just was - abbreviated it to Struct in my head, and started going with that. That element or object, I would say. Not a C_Struct. That's not what I was trying to k- though yeah. Yeah. O_K. And, um, the reason is - why I think it's a little bit more complex or why - why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is - Um. So. The, uh - Let's look at an example. Well, w- wouldn't we just take the structure that's outputted and then run another transformation on it, that would just dump the one that we wanted out? Yeah. w- We'd need to prune. Right? Throw things away. Well, actually, you don't even need to do that with X_M_L. D- Can't you just look at one specific - No- Yeah, exactly. The - Xerxes allows you to say, u- ""Just give me the value of that, and that, and that."" But, we don't really know what we're interested in before we look at the complete - at - at the overall result. So the person said, um, ""Where is X_?"" and so, we want to know, um, is - Does he want info? o- on this? or know the location? Or does he want to go there? Let's assume this is our - our question. Sure. Nuh? So. Um. Do this in Perl. So we get - O_K . Let's assume this is the output. So. We should con- be able to conclude from that that - I mean. It's always gonna give us a value of how likely we think i- it is that he wants to go there and doesn't want to go there, or how likely it is that he wants to get information. But, maybe w- we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate. So, does he wanna know where it is? or does he wanna go there? He wants to know where it is. Right. I - I - I tend to agree. And if it's - If - Well now, y- I mean, you could - And i- if there's sort of a clear winner here, and, um - and this is pretty, uh - indifferent, then we - then we might conclude that he actually wants to just know where, uh t- uh, he does want to go there. Uh, out of curiosity, is there a reason why we wouldn't combine these three nodes? into one smaller subnet? that would just basically be the question for - We have ""where is X_?"" is the question, right? That would just be Info-on or Location? Based upon - Or Go-there. A lot of people ask that, if they actually just wanna go there. People come up to you on campus and say, ""Where's the library?"" You're gonna say - y- you're gonna say, g- ""Go down that way."" You're not gonna say ""It's - It's five hundred yards away from you"" or ""It's north of you"", or - ""it's located -"" Well, I mean - But the - there's - So you just have three decisions for the final node, that would link thes- these three nodes in the net together. Um. I don't know whether I understand what you mean. But. Again, in this - Given this input, we, also in some situations, may wanna postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there now the nicest way, use a cab, or so s- wants to know it - wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there, because he wants to visit t- it or whatever. So, it - n- I mean - a- All I'm saying is, whatever our input is, we're always gonna get the full output. And some - some things will always be sort of too - not significant enough. Wha- Or i- or i- it'll be tight. You won't - it'll be hard to decide. But I mean, I guess - I guess the thing is, Yep. uh, this is another, smaller, case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty, which makes me think Bayes-net should be the way to solve these things. So if you had - If for every construction, right? Oh! you could say, ""Well, there - Here's the Where-Is construction."" And for the Where-Is construction, we know we need to l- look at this node, that merges these three things together Mm-hmm. as for th- to decide the response. And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with, we could have a finite number of nodes. O_K. Say, if we had to y- deal with arbitrary language, it wouldn't make any sense to do that, because Mm-hmm. there'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence. Mm-hmm. But since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff - So, basically, the idea is to f- to feed the output of that belief-net into another belief-net. Yeah, so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief-net. But, why - why - why only those three? Why not the whol- Well, I mean, d- For the Where-Is question. So we'd have a node for the Where-Is question. Yeah. But we believe that all the decision nodes are - can be relevant for the Where-Is, and the Where - How-do-I-get-to or the Tell-me-something-about. Is food not allowed in here? You can come in if you want. Yes, it is allowed. As long as y- you're not wearing your h- your h- headphones. Alright. Just a second. I'll be back. Well, I do- I - See, I don't know if this is a good idea or not. I'm just throwing it out. But uh, it seems like we could have - I mea- or uh we could put all of the- all of the r- information that could also be relevant into the Where-Is node answer Mm-hmm. Yep. node thing stuff. And uh - O_K. I mean - Let's not forget we're gonna get some very strong input from these sub- dis- from these discourse things, right? So. ""Tell me the location of X_."" Nuh? Or ""Where is X_ located We u- at?"" Nuh? Yeah, I know, but the Bayes-net would be able to - The weights on the - on the nodes in the Bayes-net would be able to do all that, wouldn't it? Mm-hmm. Here's a k- Oh! Oh, I'll wait until you're plugged in. Oh, don't sit there. Sit here. You know how you don't like that one. It's O_K. Oh, do I not? That's the weird one. That's the one that's painful. That hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm h- I'm happy that they're recording that. That headphone. The headphone that you have to put on backwards, with the little - little thing - and the little - little foam block on it? It's a painful, painful microphone. I think it's th- called ""the Crown"". The crown? What? Yeah, versus ""the Sony"". The Crown? Is that the actual name? Mm-hmm. O_K. The manufacturer. I don't see a manufacturer on it. You w- Oh, wait, here it is. h- This thingy. Yeah, it's ""The Crown"". The crown of pain! Yes. You're on-line? Are you - are your mike o- Is your mike on? O_K. Indeed. So you've been working with these guys? You know what's going on? Yes, I have. And, I do. Yeah, alright. s- So where are we? Excellent! We're discussing this. I don't think it can handle French, but anyway. So. Assume we have something coming in. A person says, ""Where is X_?"", and we get a certain - We have a Situation vector and a User vector and everything is fine? An- an- and - and our - and our - Did you just sti- Did you just stick the m- the - the - the microphone actually in the tea? No. And, um, I'm not drinking tea. What are you talking about? Oh, yeah. Sorry. let's just assume our Bayes-net just has three decision nodes for the time being. These three, he wants to know something about it, he wants to know where it is, he wants to go there. In terms of, these would be wha- how we would answer the question Where-Is, right? We u- This is - i- That's what you s- it seemed like, explained it to me earlier w- We - we're - we wanna know how to answer the question ""Where is X_?"" Yeah, but, mmm. Yeah. No, I can - I can do the Timing node in here, too, and say ""O_K."" Well, yeah, but in the s- uh, let's just deal with the s- the simple case of we're not worrying about timing or anything. We just want to know how we should answer ""Where is X_?"" O_K. And, um, O_K, and, Go-there has two values, right?, Go-there and not-Go-there. Let's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that. Mm-hmm. Info-on has True or False and Location. So, he wants to know something about it, and he wants to know something - he wants to know Where-it-is, Excuse me. has these values. And, um, Oh, I see why we can't do that. And, um, in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there. Our belief-net thinks he wants to go there, right? In the, uh, whatever, if we have something like Yeah. Mm-hmm. this here, and this like that and maybe here also some - You should probably make them out of - Yeah. Well, it- something like that, then we would guess, ""Aha! He, our belief-net, has s- stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is, than actually wants to go there."" Right? That it - Doesn't this assume, though, that they're evenly weighted? True. Like - I guess they are evenly weighted. The different decision nodes, you mean? Yeah, the Go-there, the Info-on, and the Location? Well, d- yeah, this is making the assumption. Yes. Like - What do you mean by ""differently weighted""? They don't feed into anything really anymore. Or I jus- But I mean, why do we - Le- If we trusted the Go-there node more th- much more than we trusted the other ones, then we would conclude, even in this situation, that he wanted to go there. So, in that sense, we weight them equally O_K. Makes sense. Yeah. right now. So the- But I guess the- k- the question - But - that I was as- er- wondering or maybe Robert was proposing to me is - How do we d- make the decision on - as to - which one to listen to? Yeah, so, the final d- decision is the combination of these three. So again, it's - it's some kind of, uh - Bayes-net. Yeah, sure. O_K so, then, the question i- So then my question is t- to you then, would be - So is the only r- reason we can make all these smaller Bayes-nets, because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions? Cuz oth- If we're just taking arbitrary language in, we couldn't have a node for every possible question, you know? A decision node for every possible question, you mean? Well, I - like, in the case of - Yeah. In the ca- Any piece of language, we wouldn't be able to answer it with this system, b- if we just h- Cuz we wouldn't have the correct node. Basically, w- what you're s- proposing is a n- Where-Is node, right? Yeah. And - and if we - And if someone - says, you know, uh, something in Mandarin So is - Yeah. to the system, we'd- wouldn't know which node to look at to answer that question, right? Yeah. Mmm? So, but - but if we have a finite - What? I don't see your point. What - what - what I am thinking, or what we're about to propose here is we're always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities. And now we need an expert system or belief-net or something that interprets that, that looks at all the values and says, ""The winner is Timing. Now, go there."" ""Uh, go there, Timing, now."" Or, ""The winner is Info-on, Function-Off."" So, he wants to know something about it, and what it does. Nuh? Uh, regardless of - of - of the input. Wh- Regardle- Yeah, but- But how does the expert - but how does the expert system know - how- who- which one to declare the winner, if it doesn't know the question it is, and how that question should be answered? Based on the k- what the question was, so what the discourse, the ontology, the situation and the user model gave us, we came up with these values for these decisions. Yeah I know. But how do we weight what we get out? As, which one i- Which ones are important? So my i- So, if we were to it with a Bayes-net, we'd have to have a node - for every question that we knew how to deal with, that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question. Mm-hmm. Does that make sense? Yay, nay? Um, I mean, are you saying that, what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation, or are we just dealing with arbitrary language? We - Is that your point? Well, no. I - I guess my question is, Is the reason that we can make a node f- or - O_K. So, lemme see if I'm confused. Are we going to make a node for every question? Does that make sense? - Or not. For every question? Like - Every construction. Hmm. I don't - Not necessarily, I would think. I mean, it's not based on constructions, it's based on things like, uh, there's gonna be a node for Go-there or not, and there's gonna be a node for Enter, View, Approach. Wel- W- O_K. So, someone asked a question. Yeah. How do we decide how to answer it? Well, look at - look - Face yourself with this pr- question. You get this - You'll have - y- This is what you get. And now you have to make a decision. What do we think? What does this tell us? And not knowing what was asked, and what happened, and whether the person was a tourist or a local, because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities. Yeah. What - what we need is a - just a mechanism that says, ""Aha! There is -"" I just don't think a ""winner-take-all"" type of thing is the - I mean, in general, like, we won't just have those three, right? We'll have, uh, like, many, many nodes. Yep. So we have to, like - So that it's no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say. Because there are interdependencies, right? The uh - Uh, no. So if - if for example, the Go-there posterior possibility is so high, um, uh, w- if it's - if it has reached - reached a certain height, then all of this becomes irrelevant. So. If - even if - if the function or the history or something is scoring pretty good on the true node, true value - Wel- I don't know about that, cuz that would suggest that - I mean - He wants to go there and know something about it? Do they have to be mutual- Yeah. Do they have to be mutually exclusive? I think to some extent they are. Or maybe they're not. Cuz I, uh - The way you describe what they meant, they weren't mutu- uh, they didn't seem mutually exclusive to me. Well, if he doesn't want to go there, even if the Enter posterior proba- So. Wel- Go-there is No. Enter is High, and Info-on is High. Well, yeah, just out of the other three, though, that you had in the - Hmm? those three nodes. The- d- They didn't seem like they were mutually exclusive. No, there's - No. But - It's through the - So th- s- so, yeah, but some - So, some things would drop out, and some things would still be important. Mm-hmm. But I guess what's confusing me is, if we have a Bayes-net to deal w- another Bayes-net to deal with this stuff, Mm-hmm. you know, uh, is the only reason - O_K, so, I guess, if we have a Ba- another Bayes-net to deal with this stuff, the only r- reason we can design it is cuz we know what each question is asking? Yeah. I think that's true. And then, so, the only reason - way we would know what question he's asking is based upon - Oh, so if - Let's say I had a construction parser, and I plug this in, I would know what each construction - the communicative intent of the construction was Mm-hmm. and so then I would know how to weight the nodes appropriately, in response. So no matter what they said, if I could map it onto a Where-Is construction, Ge- Mm-hmm. I could say, ""ah! well the- the intent, here, was Where-Is"", O_K, right. and I could look at those. Yeah. Yes, I mean. Sure. You do need to know - I mean, to have that kind of information. Hmm. Yeah, I'm also agreeing that a simple pru- Take the ones where we have a clear winner. Forget about the ones where it's all sort of middle ground. Prune those out and just hand over the ones where we have a winner. Yeah, because that would be the easiest way. We just compose as an output an X_M_L mes- message that says. ""Go there now."" ""Enter historical information."" And not care whether that's consistent with anything. Right? But in this case if we say, "" definitely he doesn't want to go there. He just wants to know where it is."" or let's call this - this ""Look-At-H-"" He wants to know something about the history of. So he said, ""Tell me something about the history of that."" Now, the e- But for some reason the Endpoint-Approach gets a really high score, too. We can't expect this to be sort of at O_ point three, three, three, O_ point, three, three, three, O_ point, three, three, three. Right? Somebody needs to zap that. You know? Or know - There needs to be some knowledge that - We - Yeah, but, the Bayes-net that would merge - I just realized that I had my hand in between my mouth and my micr- er, my- and my microphone. So then, the Bayes-net that would merge there, that would make the decision between Go-there, Info-on, and Location, would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted, and based upon that node, then you would look at the other stuff. Yep. I mean, it- i- Yep. Does that make sense? Yep. It's sort of one of those, that's - It's more like a decision tree, if - if you want. You first look o- at the lowball ones, and then - Yeah, i- Yeah, I didn't intend to say that every possible - O_K. There was a confusion there, k- I didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the Bayes-net, because some of the things aren't relevant in the Bayes-net for a specific question. Like the Endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the Bayes-net for Where-Is until after you've decided whether you wanna go there or not. Mm-hmm. Right. Show us the way, Bhaskara. I guess the other thing is that um, yeah. I mean, when you're asked a specific question and you don't even - Like, if you're asked a Where-Is question, you may not even look - like, ask for the posterior probability of the, uh, E_V_A node, right? Cuz, that's what - I mean, in the Bayes-net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node. So, I mean, you may not even bother to compute things you don't need. Um. Aren't we always computing all? No. You can compute, uh, the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes, given some other nodes, but totally ignore some other nodes, also. Basically, things you ignore get marginalized over. Yeah, but that's - that's just shifting the problem. Then you would have to make a decision, ""O_K, if it's a Where-Is question, which Yeah. So you have to make - Yeah. decision nodes do I query?"" Yes. That's un- But I would think that's what you want to do. Right? Mmm. Well, eventually, you still have to pick out which ones you look at. So it's pretty much the same problem, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah - it's - it's - it's apples and oranges. Nuh? I mean, maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance, computational time. So either you Mm-hmm. always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes, and then prune Mmm. the ones you think that are irrelevant, or you just make a p- a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those. Yeah. So basically, you'd have a decision tree query, Go-there. If k- if that's false, query this one. If that's true, query that one. And just basically do a binary search through the - ? I don't know if it would necessarily be that, uh, complicated. But, uh - I mean, it w- Well, in the case of Go-there, it would be. In the case - Cuz if you needed an- If y- If Go-there was true, you'd wanna know what endpoint was. And if it was false, you'd wanna d- look at either Lo- Income Info-on or History. Yeah. That's true, I guess. Yeah, so, in a way you would have that. Also, I'm somewhat boggled by that Hugin software. O_K, why's that? I can't figure out how to get the probabilities into it. Like, I'd look at - Mm-hmm. It's somewha- It's boggling me. O_K. Alright. Well, hopefully it's fixable. Ju- Oh yeah, yeah. I d- I just think I haven't It's - there's a - figured out what - the terms in Hugin mean, versus what Java Bayes terms are. O_K. Um, by the way, are - Do we know whether Jerry and Nancy are coming? Or - ? So we can figure this out. They should come when they're done their stuff, basically, whenever that is. So. What d- what do they need to do left? Um, I guess, Jerry needs to enter marks, but I don't know if he's gonna do that now or later. But, uh, if he's gonna enter marks, it's gonna take him awhile, I guess, and he won't be here. And what's Nancy doing? Nancy? Um, she was sorta finishing up the, uh, calculation of marks and assigning of grades, but I don't know if she should be here. Well - or, she should be free after that, so - assuming she's coming to this meeting. I don't know if she knows about it. She's on the email list, right? Is she? O_K. Mm-hmm. O_K. Because basically, what - where we also have decided, prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together O_K. sometime this week again O_K. and finish up the, uh, values of this. So we have, uh - Believe it or not, we have all the bottom ones here. Well, I - You added a bunch of nodes, for - ? Yep. O_K. We - we - we have - Actually what we have is this line. Uh, what do the, uh, Right? structures Hmm? do? So the - the - the - For instance, this Location node's got two inputs, that one you - Four inputs. Hmm. Four. Those are - The bottom things are inputs, also. Oh, I see. Yeah. O_K, that was- O_K. That makes a lot more sense to me now. Yep. Cuz I thought it was like, that one in Stuart's book about, you know, the - Alarm in the dog? U- Yeah. Yeah. Or the earthquake and the alarm. Sorry. Yeah, I'm confusing two. Yeah, there's a dog one, too, but that's in Java Bayes, isn't it? Right. Maybe. But there's something about bowel problems or something with the dog. Yeah. And we have all the top ones, all the ones to which no arrows are pointing. What we're missing are the - these, where arrows are pointing, where we're combining top ones. So, we have to come up with values for this, and this, this, this, and so forth. And maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more. And, um. And then it's just, uh, edges, many of edges. And, um, we won't meet next Monday. So. Cuz of Memorial Day? Yep. We'll meet next Tuesday, I guess. Yeah. When's Jerry leaving for - Italia? On - on Friday. Which Friday? This - this Friday. O_K. Oh. This Friday? Ugh. This Friday. As in, four days? Yep. Or, three days? Is he - How long is he gone for? Two weeks. Italy, huh? What's, uh - what's there? Well, it's a country. Buildings. People. But it's not a conference or anything. He's just visiting. Pasta. Hmm? Right. Just visiting. Vacation. It's a pretty nice place, in my brief, uh, encounter with it. Do you guys - Oh, yeah. So. Part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when - when he comes back. Um, so - Oh, I think we should disappoint him. Yeah? You - or have a finished construction parser and a working belief-net, and uh - That wouldn't be disappointing. I think w- we should do absolutely no work for the two weeks that he's gone. Well, that's actually what I had planned, personally. I had - I - I had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work, and I do nothing. And then, I sort of - Oh, yeah, that sounds good, too. sort of bask in - in your glory. But, uh, i- do you guys have any vacation plans, because I myself am going to be, um, gone, but this is actually not really important. Just this weekend we're going camping. Yeah, I'm wanna be this - gone this weekend, too. Ah. But we're all going to be here on Tuesday again? Looks like it? Yeah. O_K, then. Let's meet - meet again next Tuesday. And, um, finish up this Bayes-net. And once we have finished it, I guess we can, um - and that's going to be more just you and me, because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic, recursive, structured, object-oriented, uh, Killing machines! reasoning machines. Yes. And, um - Killing, reasoning. What's the difference? Wait. So you're saying, next Tuesday, is it the whole group meeting, or just Uh. us three working on it, or - or - ? The whole group. And we present our results, our final, O_K. definite - So, when you were saying we need to do a re-run of, like - h- What? What - Like, just working out the rest of the - Yeah. We should do this th- the upcoming days. This week? So, this week, yeah. O_K. When you say, ""the whole group"", you mean the four of us, and Keith? And, Ami might. Ami might be here, and it's possible that Nancy'll be here? Yep. So, yeah. Because, th- you know, once we have the belief-net done - You're just gonna have to explain it to me, then, on Tuesday, how it's all gonna work out. You know. We will. O_K. Because then, once we have it sort of up and running, then we can start you know, defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it, and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and - That you will have in about nine months or so. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, The first bad version'll be done in nine months. Yeah, I can worry about the ontology interface and you can - Keith can worry about the discourse. I mean, this is pretty - Um, I mean, I - I - I hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values, right? Which - where the - Which ones? S- so - so if the endpoint - if the Go-there is Yes and No, then Go-there- discourse will just be fifty-fifty. Right? Um, what do you mean? If the Go-there says No, then the Go-there is - I don't get it. I don't u- understand. Um. Like, the Go-there depends on all those four things. Yep. Yeah. But, what are the values of the Go-there- discourse? Well, it depends on the situation. If the discourse is strongly indicating that - Yeah, but, uh, we have no discourse input. Oh, I see. The d- See, uh, specifically in our situation, D_ and O_ are gonna be, uh - Yeah. Sure. So, whatever. So, so far we have - Is that what the Keith node is? Yep. O_K. And you're taking it out? for now? Or - ? Well, this is D_ - O_K, this, I can - I can get it in here. All the D_ 's are - I can get it in here, so th- We have the, uh, um, sk- let's - let's call it ""Keith-Johno node"". Johno? There is an H_ somewhere printed . There you go. Yeah. People have the same problem with my name. Yeah. Oops. And, um, Does th- th- does the H_ go b- before the A_ or after the A_? Oh, in my name? Before the A_. Yeah. O_K, good. Cuz you kn- When you said people have the same problem, I thought - Cuz my H_ goes after the uh e- e- e- the v- People have the inverse problem with my name. O_K. I always have to check, every time y- I send you an email, a past email of yours, to make sure I'm spelling your name correctly. Yeah. That's good. I worry about you. I appreciate that. But, when you abbreviate yourself as the ""Basman"" , you don't use any H_'s. ""Basman""? Yeah, it's because of the chessplayer named Michael Basman, who is my hero. O_K. You're a geek. It's O_ K. I- How do you pronou- O_K. How do you pronounce your name? Eva. Eva? Yeah. Not Eva? What if I were - What if I were to call you Eva? I'd probably still respond to it. I've had people call me Eva, but I don't know. No, not just Eva, Eva. Like if I u- take the V_ and s- pronounce it like it was a German V_ ? Which is F_. Yeah. Um, no idea then. Voiced. What? It sounds like an F_. There's also an F_ in German, which is why I - I - O_K. Well, it's just the difference between voiced and unvoiced. O_K. Yeah. As long as that's O_ K. I mean, I might slip out and say it accidentally. That's all I'm saying. Um. That's fine. Yeah. It doesn't matter what those nodes are, anyway, because we'll just make the weights ""zero"" for now. Yep. We'll make them zero for now, because it - who - who knows what they come up with, what's gonna come in there. O_K. And, um, then should we start on Thursday? O_K. And not meet tomorrow? Sure. O_K. I'll send an email, make a time suggestion. Wait, maybe it's O_K, so that - that - that we can - that we have one node per construction. Cuz even in people, like, they don't know what you're talking about if you're using some sort of strange construction. Yeah, they would still c- sort of get the closest, best fit. Well, yeah, but I mean, the - uh, I mean, that's what the construction parser would do. Uh, I mean, if you said something completely arbitrary, it would f- find the Mm-hmm. closest construction, right? But if you said something that was completel- er - h- theoretically the construction parser would do that - O_K. But if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever, n- people wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about. Mm-hmm. Like ""Bus dog fried egg."" I mean. You know. Or, if even something Chinese, for example. Or, something in Mandarin, yeah. Or Cantonese, as the case may be. What do you think about that, Bhaskara? I mean - Well - But how many constructions do - could we possibly have nodes for? In this system, or in r- No, we. Like, when people do this kind of thing. Oh, when p- How many constructions do people have? Yeah. I have not the slightest idea. Is it considered to be like in - are they considered to be like very, uh, sort of s- abstract things? Every noun is a construction. O_K, so it's like in the thousands. The - Yeah. Any - any form- meaning pair, to my understanding, is a construction. O_K. So. And form u- starts at the level of noun - Or actually, maybe even sounds. Yeah. Phoneme. Yep. And goes upwards until you get the ditransitive construction. And then, of course, the c- I guess, maybe there can be the - S- Can there be combinations of the dit- Discourse-level Yeah. constructions. The ""giving a speech"" construction, Rhetorical constructions. Yeah. Yes. But, I mean, you know, you can probably count - count the ways. I mean. It's probab- Yeah, I would s- definitely say it's finite. Yeah. And at least in compilers, that's all that really matters, as long as your analysis is finite. How's that? How it can be finite, again? Nah, I can't think of a way it would be infinite. Well, you can come up with new constructions. Yeah. If the - if your - if your brain was totally non-deterministic, then perhaps there's a way to get, uh, infin- an infinite number of constructions that you'd have to worry about. But, I mean, in the practical sense, it's impossible. Right. Cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons - ? Yeah. So the best-case scenario would be the number of constructions - or, the worst-case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons. Well, two to the power of the number of neurons. Right. But still finite. O_K. No, wait. Not necessarily, is it? We can end the meeting. I just - Can't you use different var- different levels of activation? across, uh - Mm-hmm. lots of different neurons, to specify different values? Um, yeah, but there's, like, a certain level of - There's a bandwidth issue, right? Yeah. Bandw- Yeah, so you can't do better than something. Turn off the mikes. Otherwise it gets really tough for the tr-",0
"Lauren Ballinger 05/12/08 Reaching Transcendence through the Elimination of color: The Ideal Minimalism of Black and White The world is made up of a myriad of colors. color gives distinction to our life, it gives flavor and meaning. What would our lives be without color? At the same time in our modern society, color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space. color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting and in art, has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch. We went from times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence. What is the significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to high art? Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our space? What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered non-colors? Ever since the dawn of man, human society has evolved in ways which attempt to ultimately control nature. Seeing as color is something of the natural world, age old and archaic, washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above the physical world. “Intelligent beings have a language represented by articulate sounds; organized beings, like all animals and vegetables, express themselves by cries or forms, contour or carriage. Inorganic nature has only the language of color. It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or emerald… color, then, is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature, while drawing becomes the medium of expression, more and more dominant, the higher we rise in the scale of being”(Blanc, Chromophobia, p.25). The history of color is about the ways in which man has tried to find the ideal state of being throughout the ages. In the Far East, reaching a state of colorless-ness is associated with the highest state of spiritual being, the state of Zen. What is typical of this sort of ascetism is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal. This is apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and Japan. For them, reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form. This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the artist had reached within himself, it was a means of reducing down to the essence of a thing. In the Elimination of color in the Far East, Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color. “This artistic acestism, i.e., the suppression of externals and the reduction of all colors to black and white, manifests its real aesthetic function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and their subtle hues. In other words, the true profundity of the beauty of black and white is disclosed only to those eyes that are able to appreciate the splendors of sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate shades and tints”(Izutsu, p. 169). For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as non-colors. It is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no longer present. It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space. Without color one could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space. colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place. “That is to say, under the total absence of color, there is a vague reminiscence of all colors that have been “killed”(Izutsu, p. 177). Black and white are the consummation of all colors into one. “Black is life; it is the infinite possibility of expression and development. Black here is not sheer black. For in it’s negation of all colors, all colors are positively affirmed”(Izutsu, p. 193). It is through these means that one finds the essence in a thing. In Western society, this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of generations past. Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the 18th century. Society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life, representing modernity. color became a moral issue, seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to the essence of life and form. “The predominance of color at the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute, of fleeting appearance over permanent form, of physical impression over the empire of the soul”(Chromophobia, p. 28). color rests on the surface of an object, it is superficial, cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that thing. color is associated with the Fall from Grace. It is something which speaks to the senses, not the mind, it is external and therefore secondary to life. It deals with the body, emotions, not the intellect. It strays from reason in the way which it consumes and manipulates life. “color was a permanent internal threat, an ever-present inner other which, if unleashed, would be the ruin of everything, the fall of culture. For [Charles Blanc] color also represents a kind of ruination. color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization, the nobility of the human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself – but back into which it could always slide”(Chromophobia, p. 23). It is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire, and to desire is to lose control over oneself. Thus, began the cult of the black and white. White is seen as representing spirituality, the heavens, and light, it is all which is modern, it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color. It is the control of nature, and the body and represents the modern man. “WHITE is the spiritual color of our times, the clearness which directs all out actions. It is neither grey white, nor vory white, but pure white. WHITE is the color of modern times, the color which dissipates a whole era; our era is perfection, purity, certitude. WHITE It includes everything. We have superceded both the ‘brown’ of decadence and classiscm and the ‘blue’ of divisionism, the cult of the blue ky, the gods with green beards and the spectrum. WHITE pure white.”(Chromophobia, p. 47). For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of colors. Abolishing color means controlling color. “The white surface exposes color, presents it for disciplining. It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames. But before that, it keeps an eye on itself, watching its freshly laundered and neatly folded fabric for the stain of color”(Wigly, p. 151). colorlessness is not natural, and thus proves man’s superiority over this world. On the other hand, we need color in order to distinguish black and white. Just as those from the Far East, the purity of white implies what has been washed away and thus makes the white glitter even more. White and black stand out because of color, and color stand out because of white and black. They are linked intrinsically together, one cannot go without the other. “White is the setting for color.. In a mosque for example, the architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by a strategic use of color: “All these things are clothed in a majestic coat of whitewash. The forms stand out clearly; the impeccable construction displays all its boldness. At times a high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces a blue vibration.” The sensuous vibration of the color clarifies the white surface whose limit it marks”(Wigley, p. 209). We need this opposition between color and ‘non-color’ to make distinction between the two, otherwise neither would hold such significance. White helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash, it brings together and unites. “White expresses a certain incorporeality. The use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of a space. Concrete bodies decrease the space more or less depending on their color value. Against white, one can actually establish the intensity of clashing colors; white determines the tone in the first place. Because of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize”(Wigley, p. 311). For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces. The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them. It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours of the space. “In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing, all the details of the form and color of the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background…In this a form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in “closed” spaces”(Wigley, p. 313). There is another important aspect which white is representative of, and that is the well educated and socially elite. In the 19th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white, while men dressed in black (Wigley). These distinctions proved a certain rational order, only attained by those able to afford of it. White walls, white clothing, they both require much more maintenance than something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors. Crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury, and leisure. White clothing proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work, for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white, while men who were the ones to go out and work wore black, for black did in fact hide stains. The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint. Both as well were signs of the modern age man had reached. “Pure white was de rigueur, partly because of its exciting novelty, partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture, and pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature”(Wigley, p. xvii). The use of white was proof that man had conquered nature. The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of distinguishing oneself from the vulgar, normal, lower classes. “..it is also worthy of remark, that savage nations, uneducated people, and children have a great predilection for vivid colors; that animals are excited to rage by certain colors; that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are about them, and seem inclined to banish them altogether from their presence”(Chromophobia, p. 112). Furthermore, with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes. Now, anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them. Thus said, the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low. “In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie, there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color, with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray”(The Style Engine, p. 40). Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness. Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so. This simplicity of dress was seen as a mark of the modern man. Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white. Photography took over as a means of portraiture for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to color the photographs, for the most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more “natural”. Above all, it is believed that the expanse of literacy and the printed word, mainly the newspaper, had a profound effect in influencing the choice of black and white. “This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform, a world in “black and white”. This led to the idea of writing = rationality = production that confined images, especially images in color, to the emerging field of “art”, which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive, while it assigned to the two-toned and orderly world of printed paper the role of a daily guide to existence”(The Style Engine, p. 42). The world of print was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man. Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of man’s intellect and technology. This then translated down into the world of fashion, as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space. Seeing as since the time of Aristotle, form was valued over that of color, the arts which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form. The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch. “Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy”(Greenberg). In order to meet the demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the attention of consumers. Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it reproduced it d infinitum. Greenberg continues by saying, “Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money -- not even their time”. With the advent of kitsch came a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms. Avant guard at the time was considered to be true art, while this kitsch was simply pure imitation. Thus said, this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious, high art, while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes. Of course during the early stages of color film and photography, the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images. For the play of light and form was key in demonstrating the true art form. That was what made up the essence of an image, not the artificial, or superficial filling in of form with color. Color was thought to distract the viewer from the soul of the image. These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality. Still though black and white is seen as something of a more sober tradition. Photographers still use black and white and white is still the most widely used color for walls within gallery spaces. These non colors allow for the appreciation of color. When something is black and white, it allows the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen. Many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them. It is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process. It forces one to imagine, it forces one to delve into the core of the object. Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color, the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years. Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color, but perhaps it is human instinct, to want to surpass and rebel against generations before, so possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration. Thus is the ebb and flow of life.",0
"If you're popular. One two three four five six - I'm on seven. We're on. It's probably the P_Z_Ms. Yeah. So, I think we pre-crashed, so I think we're O_K. Pre-crashed. So it should be a really short meeting, I hope. Uh, agenda items, number one, I wanna talk - since we were just discussing that - is microphone issues. What the heck are we gonna do about microphones? So uh I got passed on that the E_D_U group doesn't like the Oh. uh, Crown mikes. I do. I l- I think - I find them very comfortable. Uh, but it seems to depend on your head shape. Who does? I do. Yeah, I do too. So you guys need to start going to the E_D_U meetings. I see. Yeah right. They don't work for me very well. I much prefer these. That's right. Yep. Um, Yeah. Me too. So do I. I prefer these, but I don't mind using those. Right. Th- those are intimidating. So apparently they - they like It has one good effect, that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike. O_K. Interesting. People who show up late have to use these. So, um, we should probably get different mikes. So the question is, the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more, um, Sony mikes. Just two more of those, um. And that - that's easy and that will certainly work. The other option is to try yet another mike. Find one we like and potentially get six, all the same. I have a question about this. Are the auditory quality - Is it, uh, much different between this kind and the - the fancy ones? Um, these are better, if they're worn correctly. They are. O_K. Those are better than the Sonys? Have you - Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Have you listened to - to them? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. O_K. So, I mean, they're not a lot better, but they are a little better. Are they more directional, the microphones, as far as - Um, they're more directional, a little better error - uh, noise cancellation, and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth, like this, whereas that one, to avoid breath noise, you really have to put it at - to the side. O_K. So you seem to get better signal with this one. The other thing is, is it just a few people who don't like them in the E_D_U group? Cuz - I don't know, but - you know, in - in sort of random polling L- Liz - Liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them. They are ver- Gosh, cuz I much prefer them, I think they're a whole lot, multiple levels, better. It seems a shame t- to discard - discard them if - if they're better auditory quality and there're only a few people who dis- who object. I mean, so s- Right. Yeah, that's why I was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in. Well, I mean, that's the other option, is that we could switch the form so it's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike, um, and then get You know, pretty - duplicates. I mean, there's no problem with that. It's just - what - Hmm. Should we get just more Sony ones? I hate the Sony ones. Which ones are those? b- the one you're wearing. Because it - it pinches - The one I'm wearing? Oh. Those. pinches the temples too much. Oh. And - I mean, so, if you wear it sort of around the back, it's not too bad. Yeah. I hate it because it's hard to adjust the microphone. I mean, I spend all this time fumbling around with it and still not Yeah. But I - Right. reasonable, yeah. Right. So, I mean, we could try another mike. But then we have the wiring issue, and - So I - I don't know what to do. What do - what do people think? But the problem is again the - the plug, or - ? Wh- The plug is proprietary. So that's why I was saying getting more Sony ones is trivial, because we can just go out and buy them. Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired. O_K. O_K. O_K. Yeah. O_K, n- now may- maybe I just don't know this but, um, are the only two possibilities from Sony the two that we've tried? Or is there another - Yes. So, the only possibilities from Sony are that one and the lapel mike. I see. O_K. O_K. Oh, I see. So this isn't Sony. This is Crown. The one we're wearing. Isn't that something. O_K. And so we had these wired for us. Oh. I see. O_K. Well, it s- It seems like right now if - if u- what they're complaining are those, if we just got two more of these - And so - Huh, I remember that now. I think that's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately, and have them available. Yeah. O_K. And then they can just unplug those from the - Right. And just make sure that you write down ""Crown"" or ""Sony"" on the mike number, which I'll change to mike type, or something like that. transmitter. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too, cuz that would be an easy place for, uh, an error in the data. Yep. For it to be forgotten. Well, it'll be me - It'll be whoever's setting up the meeting, who fills out the key file, so O_K, it's just - I'm just thinking that if - it'd be - yeah, but I know - but I mean to have the user fill it out wouldn't be as reliable as have the - It has the same potential for error as everything else. No, no, we definitely would not have the user fill it out. It would be me, Chuck, or Liz, depending on which meeting it is. Good, O_K. Perfect. Perfect, O_K. O_K, so we'll de- definitely go ahead and do that. How much is it just to buy the mike? Couple hundred. Really. Yeah. Is that more or less than you thought? It depends on how good the mike is. Oh that's way more than I thought. I - yeah. Oh, O_K. Yeah. For one of these? Well the Crown ones were like two-fifty. I think those are like one-ninety. God. Oops. Wow! But. Is there any educational discount? Yeah right. No. Student discount. Yeah, good mikes are expensive. So. And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure, the S_M-ten-A's, and I think they were only like eighty bucks or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah, eighty or ninety for the Shures. So. Yeah. But they were - they seemed pretty good. I mean, the Sony ones are expensive because they're proprietary, so they can charge whatever they want. These are expensive because they're quite high quality. So. Oh. Right, right. So we should buzz that out if we send the data to Sony. Ah, come on. We should keep a list of things we're gonna bleep out and the conditions under which - Well, I'm just joking. So, you do not have to bleep that out. I don't mind if Sony knows my opinion. So. Hmm. Um. Also, we're pro- I wanna double check with Morgan, he did say yes before I went to Japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless, instead of the mix of wired and wireless. And I think that's the right thing to do. So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones? And I'm - Yeah. Yep. Cool. Yep. Uh-huh. Four more wireless. Um. And also I'm gonna re- probably replace the Andrea mike with a Shure, but I'll test it, uh, sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works, cuz I have an extra Shure in my office. The Andrea mike? Yeah. Yeah, apparently it's had some problems. That's causing problems, yeah. Which one is the Andrea mike? It was over here sometimes. A wired one? The - yeah a wired one. Yeah. It's uh - Well, if you're gonna go to all wireless, Oh, you mean in the meantime. This one. In the meantime, right, because uh - Ah, I see. Yeah. it'll - it'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway. Yeah. I haven't - In the meetings that I recorded s- So - It's always been at most six people, so I've never had to - Oh really? Yeah. Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all. I guess cuz everyone's been out of town. Probably over the summer it'll be the same cuz it tends to be less, Yeah. fewer people. Um, File - Uh, done with microphone issues, I think? Should we close the door? If you want. Oh, I'm thinking - I don't know about the acoustics. That's - that's all I was wondering about. And this way we can get a door-slam in the uh - in the transcript file. Yeah. Yeah that's right, we gotta get the obligatory door-slam. Oh well. No- not quite a slam. There's some knocks. Get a special phone for that. Mm-hmm. Uh, the door-slam phone? I guess, right, the door-slam phone. Yeah. You have a special phone? No, we could add one. Oh, we could add one, yeah. And then we could have the phone phone, Yeah. That's an idea. for - for when the phone rings. Um, Uh, file reorganization. This is something we were talking about before I left and saying we should probably wait until after I'm back, and now I'm back, so, we should do that at some point. So we should get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else. Can I - can I just mention something? Sure. Um, uh, I think the file regards reorganization. Also, um, another issue there is disk space probably, right? Um, so Mm-hmm. I know that the files that you've been cutting up for us f- for the recognition experiments, uh, one way - one really Mm-hmm. brain - uh, brain-dead way of - of - of not causing any trouble, but saving disk space is to, uh, use the s- the Sphere, the NIST, uh, W_encode program. to - to encode, you know, to compress them. Shorten. Is that the same as shorten? Uh, yeah, but it does it s- it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently. Yeah. Well, O_K, you mean it's built into the S_R_I, because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools. So. Y- uh, I guess, but it um, So it's just a question of - of what decompression is built into your tools. Well, it's - Well like - Hhh. It's actually built into the Sphere library that NIST delivers, so - Right. Oh really? I didn't know that. And actually, s- the sound tools don't understand that. For the - At least Feacalc doesn't. At least Feacalc doesn't. So. Well, that's not a sound tool, right. But since - since these files are made to be used with the S_R_I recognizer, uh and the S_R_I front-end uses the Sphere library which in turn does this transparently um, uh, that will be a quick and - quick and easy way to just, uh, get you know, uh, be able to use more - Yeah. Mm-hmm. The other thing I could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything to my eighteen gig disk, which is local. But that's gonna be only temporary. Well, I mean, I don't know - I mean, you should do that too, probably, but - but as you do that you can also just run the - Yeah, it is kind of a temporary solution. To shorten everything. well, actually, the - th- what you do is you run - Oh, now I have another use for the - The way I recently used it, and there might be better ways - So the program's called W_encode. Mmm. And I think the type, y- you say um I think dash T_ and then there are different - different encoding methods, but if you wanna use the shorten one, you say d- ""minus T_ shorten"", and then the old uh wavefile and the new wavefile, and then - Oops! And then I check, you know, if this works, so, you can use the - the shell ""AND"" operator or something. Then I just move the new wavefile to the, you know, to the old Right. wavefile, and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to Mm-hmm. decode it on the fly. And that - O_K. that just saved my butt because I actually was running - On a different experiment, I had segmented - I was processing the whole Switchboard-two corpus, which is two hundred eighty hours of speech, and I was noticing, as I was almost finishing the processing, that I was running out of disk space. Mm-hmm. And - and so I uh had this flash of inspiration of just uh the same - the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them, so I - Shortening everything on the fly. while this other thing was still going on, I was run- I was running this - this thing. You had another process running that was shortening it. Yep. Wow, wow! And low and behold I gained three g- three gig of space and um, you know - Wow! Did you have to re-nice one of the processes to make sure that ""shorten""? No, no. Actually it was fast enough. This is very fast. This - this really runs quickly. And that's - Wow. That must have been suspenseful. Watching the disk meter. That was very suspenseful. That was - that was the most excitement I had all weekend. Uh, uh boy, it uh came out just fine. So. To be O_K. You know what would be a - u- I don't know if this would mess other things up, but - It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around. What would be easier would be like pointers. The list, yep. You know, lists like ""original wavefile, start, end"". Start end. This is - Yep, the way Feacalc - calc does it. Right, the - the only reason we do this is because the - the S_R_I front-end doesn't have a way to - to um go into a l- a longer file with indices. Um, so I - I suppose And segment on the fly. someone could try to put a hack like that into the - It would be easy. It wouldn't be hard at all. Someone just needs to d- sit down and do it who has some time. So. But there's also some - I guess - And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around. About the only difficulty with that is if it's compressed. Then you really do have to decompress it first. That's true. Right? Because the pointers are - Y- you don't know how much it's comp- Well, is there - is there - is there a NIST routine which It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount. Exactly. Right right right right right. can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices? I don't think so. And yeah I mean, that - it - No, no. I mean, if you - Th- the - the - the - If you can operate on the full - If you don't have to segment it, then there would be less of a reason to do the compression, because you don't have that wasted - Right. that extra copy. So. Right we - I mean the original Switchboard files are not compressed, right? So we could leave those as they are. Yeah. Right. Well, I mean, it just depends on how much disk space is a problem. I mean the - what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it. Right. But. I mean, the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions. Just silences, yeah. And if you have, you know, twenty channels and only five speakers, then it's - That's true. Mm-hmm. Well, assuming you'd - Yeah. Assuming that you then off-load the original Yeah. Switchboard files. So. Mmm. Yeah. Well, it seems like just shortening them is a good short-term solution so we don't have to do any coding. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But I think - kind of - We've had - There was a big disk crash when you were gone and - So. No, it was - I was still here. It was the day I left. Oh was that the day you left? That's suspicious. He did it on purpose. Yeah. Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes. No if I - if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right after I left. But, um - Yeah so, Chuck helped me out in, uh, r- regenerating all the cha- the different channel files for like a few meetings - for like six meetings. So I think they're split up even further. It's kind of even more disorganized now since Mm-hmm. we moved some of the meetings to different directories. They're on a different disk even, right? Are they? I think - you - didn't you expand them to X_E on Abbott? X_F. No, you - the ones that Oh, different ones? You - the ones that you put them on when you put them on X_E. I don't remember where I put them now. I think you put them on X_E. So. O_K. Well what we - what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was - it - w- with a - with a meta disk allocation, you had both c- t- transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on X_E - were on the same - sorry, different partitions of the same physical disk. Physical disk. Mmm. And it's conceivable I mean, I - I don't - I mean, so um, I was told that it's possible that that might have, uh, caused additional wear on it. Maybe caused it to - to go bad sooner. Well, I think there was something else going on, because uh Dave Johnson said that D_D was getting accessed frequently. And it shouldn't be. Hmm. Oh. Uh-huh. Right? That data never gets touched, because we write it once and then we never touch it again. Well, why not? Oh sure it does. Yeah, after each meeting we copy the data to - Except that - Well, I mean, so the wavefiles, or - or anything at all, because the transcripts are there as well. The wave files. I mean, he was saying gigabytes. Oh, gigabytes. I see. And so, it has to be the wave files. Yeah, there was something weird about that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet, but we should definitely double check on it. Yeah like - like the same meeting - shortened, files that we pull off of Popcorn when we're done doing the recording, Yeah. looked, to the backup software, as if they had been written, you know, every single night, Every night. Is that right. i- for - f- you know, a week in a row, which is really weird. That's very strange. I didn't realize that. O_K. Wow. So at any rate, so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we're gonna do and then when we're gonna do it. Yeah. So I'm not sure who isn't involved with that. I mean, certainly me, Chuck and Jane. Anyone else care? And I - and I'd like, in terms of the conventions, to also, uh, you know, s- send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it's - if there's any - get his input on it. I don't think - I don't think that'll be - Yeah. No. Right. So, maybe we should do that Yeah. not during this meeting but s- another time, and just get a list of everything we're gonna do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe n- next week if we could. I'm trying to finish up some stuff. O_K. Yeah sure. I'd like to - So just update all the naming conventions and put all the files where they really belong, on one disk, That sounds like a good idea. and then leave - leave everything in place until the back-up - until the next full back-up and then delete the old ones. Mm-hmm. O_K, now - and you're just - you're not talking about the s- the X_ disks - the X_ uh partitions, just the backed up space, or - ? So. Well, both need to be reorganized. O_K. So um, various paths, th- I mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way, because um I think we should also at the same time try to, uh, convert over to your new naming conventions. Yes, exactly. That too. That'd be good. So that's what I was saying. We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do. Yeah. O_K. And so I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out, so I assume that's alright with everyone. I actually haven't looked at it yet. I haven't had a chance, so. No. Hmm. I haven't either. Sorry. Oh. And - I will by next week, though. Uh, I don't know about the naming, I mean, O_K. Then I should have made that as an agenda item. Th- so these names that we've been using so far are with uh uh uh I wouldn't just wanna change them you know, without some advance notice. Right. I mean, th- that's all these segment names that we- we've been using. I would rather not mess with them Yeah. Yeah, I'm - until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently Right. dealing with, so - Well, I mean, how you choose to do it - the naming is up to you. Right. Well, So. You're talking about different files. I mean, it should probably be - eventually should probably be consistent with what you're doing but, Yep. yeah, I kind of agree with Andreas, like I'm a little bit - I mean, these - I looked at the naming conventions and they look fine to me, but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be - Well, if we - If we change things, it won't really affect what you're doing, will it? This - No but I think just to be consistent we should also, I mean, have the same conventions, just in case you want - Right. Yeah. So you - but you can switch that any time you want, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's only gonna affect my work. So. Yeah, it's not gonna - I mean, if we - I assume you're not gonna go, like, into, you know, my directories and change my file names. So. Yeah. Everybody will use it. Fine slash U_ slash star. Right. I - Actually I was gonna do a global search-replace on all entries at - at ICSI to change M_R to M_R_M at all places at ICSI. Yeah, that'd be great. Really enjoy that. With no - with no advance warning. Y- you - Well, maybe I shouldn't say that on re- record. O_K. There was a typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone, one of our sponsors, did a global sear- search and replace for - between ""sponsor"" and their name. Mm-hmm. Oh no, oh no. And so, it - it was saying, uh - Well, anyway, I won't - Yeah, one - one can imagine that that might be problematic. I'm not sure whether that's right. Yeah, one can imagine the problems that that would engender. But this - this name change affects a subset, doesn't need to reflect everything, yeah. So. Right. Right. Um, Thilo, you had - you wanted to talk about the - Yeah, I had one - one short point. I have just installed a Transcriber version on one of our N_T machines so it's available under Windows now. Oh great. Actually someone - I just got an email this week from someone as- Isn't that great? Yeah I re- responded to sh- I have already responded to him. I - I don't know what - what - what he - what the problem was. It was really straightforward, really easy. To Anant? And this is not - Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm sorry, I - I just - So, who did you talk to? There was some - some guy from S_R_I who wanted to - to install - Yeah. Anant? Anant Venkataraman? O_K. Yeah. And he sent an email that he couldn't - couldn't install it and I - I just described him, well, what I did and it was really straightforward, so. Yeah, O_K. Great. Yeah, O_K. Great. Great. Thanks. Thanks. And this is not just the Transcriber, this is the Channeltrans, right? Yeah, it's the Channeltrans, so the - Yeah. Yeah, excellent. the Cool. things that Dave Gelbart - Excellent. So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place. So that it'll work on all the N_T machines. Well, I mean, as it stands, I - I guess - yeah I see what you mean. It'll - it'll be on the - on the UNIX side but accessible through the H_drive. Yeah. O_K. I've - Right. O_K. Yeah. I could do that. So I assume Tcl-T_K wasn't already on the machine, so you had to install it. Yeah. I had i- to install it, yeah. Huh. Yeah. Uh So Andreas, would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going? Uh - Oh, well, yeah I - I - I actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it, because it has uh very little to do with - with meeting recordings, but Hmm. you know, I did uh run um some recognition experiments with ICSI front-end. Um Uh, and - and you know, this is the j- joint work with Chuck, and uh, um. So, first, uh, you know, we had - we figured out sometime last week how to um - and - and Chuck wrote this really nice little script - Perl script that takes a uh waveform, runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the - into um a f- c- so-called uh cepstra file, which is what the S_R_I system uses to read features. It's essentially uh uh NIST headered uh waveform. You know, it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have feature vectors following the header. Hmm. Mm-hmm. And um that's all done um by the script, and it works great. And uh I first trained up two systems, because it's gender-dep- you know, the S_R_I system is gender-dependent so to be comparable, I trained uh um on a sh- on a so-called short training set um a male system and a female system, and uh also for debugging purposes, and for the heck of it, I trained um - trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the S_R_I front-end from scratch, um, and compared the two - So, w- what features did you use? Well, we used, uh, twelve P_L_P uh, uh - So not RASTA, just P_L_P. Just P_L_P. Just P_L_P and actually that - uh, one of the questions I had was what the RASTA would possibly buy us. But um, we'll talk about that later. So, the uh - so the baseline system - w- the S_R_I system was - uh used - uh also uh uh used t- twelve uh mel - uh mel cepstra um based on a twenty-four filter bank um analysis. Um I do not know what - So the f- the bandwidth of the um S_R_I front-end is from hundreds hertz to th- th- thirty-se- thirty-seven fifty or something like that. Thirty-seven fifty. And I do not know what the um ICSI um front-end would do. I mean, what the bandwidth is. Um, but the results are such that uh, let's see - There's one other slight difference, right? Or two - two differences. Oh yeah. So the S_R_I system also does um vocal tract length normalization and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features. So that's one difference. And the other difference is that in the, uh - in the S_R_I system, the uh th- the first - the C_zero, the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest. And what they do is Huh. they d- they subtract the maximum - For each waveform segment they subtract the maximum of - of th- over that waveform segment from from the values of - for that waveform. Which is a kind of automatic gain control, that is localized - Do they subtract the max from each i- one or do they subtract each one from the max? Who cares? They subtract - Doesn't matter? No, just would be a sign change. Except you get a lot of negatives the other way. Right, right, right. Um, and then, after - But after they done this waveform based normalization, they then do a conversation length normalization just like all the other features. So it's their kind of two stage normalization. Oh! Oh! Um now, I understand that the common practice here has been to just do c- standard uh mean subtraction, um on the waveform. Um. For the C_zero. Right. But in what we've done so far, because we didn't have any special provision for C_zero , we just treat it as - as any of the other features, we've done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side. So um since both S_R_I and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C_zero that's presumably, you know, someone has done some experiments to - and found out that that works better. Um, so that's another difference, and that might account for some of the discrepancies in the results. Um, but you know. So the the results are um Where should I start? Uh the - So there's a two - Oh. I tried it with and without. Uh. So without and with adaptation. How many iterations? For the adaptation? Mm-hmm. Well, y- we always do three E_M iterations to O_K. and it's - it's this - it's this quick and dirty - the phone loop adaptation which doesn't actually require prior recognition paths and - and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation, but it gives you sort of a first idea of what you could gain with it. And then, you know, so we have the the S_R_I front-end and the ICSI front-end and other than that the system configuration was identical. So it was the same - They came up with um you know, same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster Um, same - The clustering used the same information loss threshold, which actually led to roughly the same number of Gaussians overall. So that the system configuration is - is comparable. Um, and the - Uh, so without adaptation, you had forty-nine p- That's error rate or recognition rate? This is error rate in percent. And with adaptation it's forty-seven point one and this - this was fifty-two point six. and fifty-one point three Hmm. and then, when I combined them - I can actually combine them with something like ROVER. It's actually more sophisticated than ROVER but it's - Um, here I got forty-eight point five and here I got forty-six point five. So this is just combination at the utterance level. Um. At the utterance level, right. Why do you think the ICSI front-end is so much worse? Good question. That's fine . That seems really odd to me. Um, so, one percent I would attribute to the lack of V_T_L, about one percent. O_K. Oh right. Right, right, right. O_K. Ah O_K. And then maybe another up - I don't know how much the C_zero normalization business really matters I can't it see, I mean can't see it - the Ca- can you run the S_R_I - Just as an experiment, run the S_R_I front-end without vocal tract norma- normalization, and see how much difference it makes? I could. Yeah. I could certainly do that. Yeah. Um. We could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the ICSI features. That's something we wanted to do - yeah. We could - I was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the M_F_C_C's Yeah. If we could figure out how. Yeah. and just try them with the ICSI uh front-end. Because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um - to the P_L_P c- uh Dan added the - Yeah, Dan added that in, but - Yeah, but the - So. They won't - they don't correspond one-to- one though. No, but they should be close, since this - I mean the - Anyway. But I can certainly try the S_R_I front-end without uh V_T_L. That sh- that's - that's certainly quick to do. Yeah. Um and so - Yeah, and - and then there's all these um - You know, the number of um - You know, this front-end u- had a fair amount of experimentation going into it. You know, how many Mm-hmm. filter banks do you use, what - what bandwidth do you use, and stuff like that. And uh we could play the same kind of games with the ICSI front-end. Right. Uh, actually, the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role. We used to use a narrow bandwidth and uh uh that hurt us. So this is, um - And this is - We've now used roughly what everybody else is using. So Hmm. um, there's some room for improvements, I figure, in this - in the ICSI front-end. Um. So. But the good news is that even with this - with the ICSI system being that much worse, you still get a win out of combining the two. So that gives some hope for the future. Um. Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation, so. Um. Also interestingly the - Um, the difference actually widens. I would actually expect it or - or hope that the adaptation reduces the difference because it might um, for instance, um remove some of the um - You know, som- If you - if you have some - some difference in the front-end processing that uh is suboptimal, but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the um moving the models around. But - but apparently that doesn't - doesn't really - actually the difference becomes larger, so. Um. Anyway. So right now what I'm doing is um - Uh well, there's several things going on. One is that Chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem - the system on the tandem features. So that would actually be the more interesting experiment. Um, the other thing is I'm training uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models and then we can - Right. And I actually want to do the system combination um with our eval system um, on some subset of the data at least, probably only for the males, because I don't have time to train both males and females, but um. Uh and um - What about ta- concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one? It gets pretty big. It does get pretty big. Yeah. Hmm. And m- my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better. Hmm. So. For - for whatever that's worth. Oh, you tried that on Broadcast News? Concatenating Oh yeah. Yeah. So w- Yep. different feature sets? Yeah. Did you try uh - It was mostly M_S_G, P_L_P, RASTA. I see. So, you know, the feature sets we had available. And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level. You know, so we'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities. I see. O_K. Alright. Oh. Yeah, and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors. And that would Yep. blow up the You'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards uh - so that they're uh orthogonal. Right. So you'd wanna do a linear transform also. Right. Um so the - Yeah, and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the ICSI front-end to perform better. Um. And - and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can - I can certainly run a S_R_I system without V_T_L Yep. just uh to get - Wi- without what? Without V_T_L. O_K. Just - Vocal tract thing, yeah. Wh- Yeah. And that - that's quick to do. So. I was thinking about tandem system - Well, let's not talk about it here, but I had some thoughts about the tandem system. yeah so but things are moving ahead, so O_K, should we do digits? Digits. Sure. Do we have any other topics? O_K, let's do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time. Poetic reading of digits. Oh no.

"The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most long-lasting and controversial ones ever. What, exactly, causes homosexuality? Some would say it is a gene, passed on from parents to child. Others would argue that it is a result of a child’s upbringing. Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be cured. Perhaps then, it is a combination of some of these? No one knows for sure, and it is possible no one ever will, but that surely does not stop everyone from coming up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter. Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of the time, where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence (Emond). In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote “Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men” (qtd. in Isay 11). This shows that not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male, he also believed that it began at a very young age, as the word “boyhood” signifies. In fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only “real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy. Furthermore, there were many occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology; Hercules is rumored to have had 14 male lovers, and Zeus himself partook in such behavior. Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love (Emond). But it was not until 1869 that the term “homosexual” was first used, to describe “a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex” (Marcus 1). (However, for the purposes of this paper, homosexuality will be looked at solely in terms of men). At this point in time, Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia. Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for “sex,” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex” (Marcus 1). It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was started by Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician, sex researcher, leading sexologist, homosexual, and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany, who believed that homosexuality was biological in nature (Marcus 10). Hirschfeld also founded the Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897. The committee published many books and other forms of literature, which gave Hirschfeld a great amount of prestige in his field. He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later. Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to “cure” homosexuals with the use of hormone injections. This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in1864. The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while the second, Inclusa, which followed shortly after, described the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire. Ulrichs believed that Urnings were attracted to other males because they were “hermaphrodites of the mind,” meaning while they may have been male in body, they were female in soul and mind, leading them to be naturally attracted to males in terms of sexual partners. This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph 175, a law adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable . Ulrichs claimed that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn (Wikholm). A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed homosexuality to be a natural behavior. In an interview in 1903, he professed his beliefs: “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick. They also do not belong in a court of law!” (qtd. in Isay 3). In 1935, he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous “Letter to an American Mother” of a homosexual, which stated that “Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals” (qtd. in Isay 3). However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness. Treatments such as castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures. By the mid 1900s, psychotherapy became the most common “cure,” and many homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual preference (Dudley 125). Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud. In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual and half heterosexual. She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that homosexuality was a mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; “gay” men were no more insane than their “straight” counterparts (Marcus 183). Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973. Just over a year later, the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses (Marcus 11). The American Psychological Association further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure” homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment. It stated, rather that homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person, but must still be respected as an individual orientation, and thus treated as one (Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation). Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics. For two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment). In total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual, either by self-identification or other means. Out of the 56 homosexual males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately 22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 % of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics. Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %, had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard). More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a “choice,” but rather a feeling that one is born with. As one grows older, they become aware of sexual feelings towards other persons. The only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex. Therefore, neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a “choice” in the matter, and asking a homosexual “Why are you attracted to other members of your sex” is likened to asking a heterosexual “Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?” After all, why would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle? As a homosexual, one risks horrifying their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more. Rather, the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference; whether to act on one’s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings, or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus 9). To supplement my findings from research, I have conducted personal interviews with two adolescent homosexual males, James Dobbens and Daniel Woods. Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. nurture) and why, when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions. Both believed that homosexual was a result of nature, rather than nurture (Dobbens & Woods). Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual; “They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’ (Dobbens). Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual. When why he was a homosexual, he explained “It’s just the way you are, you can’t explain it, I was just born that way, it’s like asking how the world was made – no one really knows” (Dobbens). He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it. When discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality, he commented “They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up” (Dobbens). Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature, rather than nurture, when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like [homosexuality]” (Woods). When asked why he was gay, he explained that it is simply “something that I can’t help… embedded in my head; nothing made me do it” (Woods). He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females, only it was between males and other males. He added that “nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there. I’ve always been attracted to guys” (Woods). What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend and to be close with other females, etc… but never in a sexual sense. Though he has “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods). He says that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust, maybe he could work it out. He then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic; “It’s like race. It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it” (Woods). When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct. He gave the example of birds, which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build a next, or catch their prey. Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo. All in all, Woods views homosexuality as “fascinating.” His final thought: “I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction. It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a spectrum” (Woods). Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics. According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while the disadvantageous ones eventually die out. For instance, heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to females. Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits. Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences. Since neither of these events have yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene (Fulkerson). My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality. No one knows for sure now (although many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth. Nonetheless, I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes. Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations. However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors. This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality, this was not the case 100 % of the time. This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write this, new studies are being done. Perhaps the truth is right around the corner. Works Cited APA Online. 2003.

"Amanda Bates November 11, 2008 Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. Lai, Whalen. ""From Folklore to Literate Theater: Unpacking ""Madame White Snake""."" Asian Folklore Studies 51, no. 1 (1992): 52. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in “Pagoda”. Whalen Lai notes, “She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”. Ibid., 53. But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Oxford English Dictionary, “Femme, ” Oxford University Press, http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50083541/50083541se3?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=femme+fatale&first=1&max_to_show=10&hilite=50083541se3 ), is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”. Ueda, Akinari. Ugetsu Monogatari : Tales of Moonlight and Rain : A Complete English Version of the Eighteenth-Century Japanese Collection of Tales of the Supernatural. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1974, 162-164. In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans. Diana Yu, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”. Christine Gledhill, “Klute 1: A Contemporary Film Noir and Feminist Criticism,” in Feminism and Film, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 81. While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend. She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature. The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories. A simple reading of the story might produce the idea that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man, and she must be defeated and punished by society. This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored. In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda. Her husband becomes a monk, and this further implicates Lady White Snake, this time from a Buddhist perspective. Female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to Nirvana. Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man. He is weak-willed and not particularly useful. In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you. But you, yourself, owing to a lack of courage and spirit, fell victim to their temporary form” Ugetsu Monogatari, 177-178. . The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery. But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere? If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character. Instead, both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality. Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty: “I searched everywhere, and now that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,” Ibid.,173. she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her. She pleads with him, “We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea, and we must live and die together. Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?” “Eternal Prisoner,” 369. In another traditional vernacular story, “Tsu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jewel Box in Anger, “Tu Shih-Niang Sinks the Jew Box in Anger,” trans, Richard M. W. Ho, in Y. W. Ma and Joseph S. M. Lau. Traditional Chinese Stories : Themes and Variations. Boston: Zheng & Zui Co, 1986, 358. ” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s. So her husband’s failure to follow through on his end of the bargain, completely forgetting the love he once had for her, makes readers more sympathetic to Madame White Snake’s plight. However, no matter how much sympathy Madame White Snake may gather from readers, the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda. These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories, which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued. In the initial versions of this story Madame White Snake harmed her human lover, so her entrapment under a pagoda by a Taoist monk or later, a Buddhist monk Lai, 53. would have been a satisfying ending. Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat. Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake, so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force, from watching the transgressions themselves. In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end. She writes, “the final ‘lesson’ of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.” Janey Place, “Women in Film Noir” in Women in Film Noir, ed. E. Ann Kaplan (London: British Film Institute, 2003), 48. In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover. This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories. However, consciously or unconsciously, these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine. In fact, Communists in the PRC in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy. Lai, 52. Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist, so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.",0
"I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings. And one particular movie theater we went to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story. So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place. So we would go every Saturday morning. And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people. And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs going up to a balcony, real wide stairs. And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture. And they'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes. Is that for real? That's for real! That really happened! And one time I can remember, I think it was Steve, my brother, um, he, and they would give treats like candy, I don't even remember what all kinds of prizes the would give. But for some reason, and I think this is really true, he got ice cream sandwiches! Like a box of ice cream sandwiches. And of course there's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you're at a 2-hour movie! They're going to melt! And another, um, that was in, that was in High Point, NC. And then we moved to Charlotte and we used to go to - and I don't think its even still there I don't know if the building is or not - but the Dilworth Theatre. I lived in the Dilworth area, and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in. And we would, could go to the movie. We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie, and I sound like I'm 95 years old- -with those kinds of prices. Um, but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your, your snack that you wanted. And there were several different choices. I don't ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until I was a teenager or in my adult life. But we would, uh, buy, lollipops is what they call them now, but we called them suckers and we would get often a 2-cent sucker. Are you making fun? No, I love this story. And the 2-cent suckers is what is referred to now as a Tootsie Roll Pop. And we called them 2-cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny. Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle. And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker, just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long. And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre. And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this. We would go into the bakery and we would ask for- -a nickel worth of scraps! And we didn't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie. And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking, mistakes. So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us. And that's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now. I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre. And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie. I mean, my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back, but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do it. And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that. Which is kind of sad that you can't do that anymore and it's not just because things are, there're bad people in the world but it's too much traffic. You have to check everything about a movie, check it out to see what the content is and just wasn't like that when I was growing up . Also about that same time period in my life, I guess again between seven and ten years old, which seems to be what I remember most vividly, my best friend uh, was Kathy Josey, and she was a next door neighbor also, and we remained friends up until, uh, she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer. But we, we remained close friends. In fact we shared an apartment, first apartment either one of us ever had. And when we were, um, little girls we used to play ""Career Girls""! We did! And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen. And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up, we sure did; we got an apartment. Uh-huh. Um, Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just, it seems like, I remember we both had like our mother's long skirts, or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers. But we had, Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother's and I didn't have the necklace. And it was really beautiful and I really, really wanted one. So we only had the one necklace and we, er, we decided, I don't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever, but she said I could wear it part of the time. And we would literally time the amount of time, we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever. And the way we decided who got to wear it first, and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally, she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than I am. So, it, that became a normal thing with us. Whenever we only had one of something she would always say, ""Well, I think the youngest one gets to do it, or wear it or whatever first."" And, that just always stuck in my mind, that in, in our adult life I brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she didn't know anything about that and I thought to myself, ""she does,"" and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one. Um, also we did a lot of pretending and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups. And my sister and I used to pretend also and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am, maybe two and a half, and we used to play Robin Hood except we didn't have a Maid Marion, we had a Saretha, I don't know where in the world that name came from. But we would switch playing Robin Hood, one would play Robin Hood and one would play Saretha. And Saretha was the counter, would be the same thing as Maid Marion, and, why, again, I don't know why we didn't use Maid Marion. But in my mind I can remember playing that, like all day long. And we would go over to my grandparents' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and, uh, banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch. And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or, uh, it could be a castle; just do many things with it. Um, and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge, I don't know, I guess it was an oak tree, but it was a really big tree, but it was a climbable tree. And it had real large, thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches. And that was another game that Jill and I used to play; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant. And in the yard, we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted, um, flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a, as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever. When I was a teenager, an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark. And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old; we were of driving age. And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with and there were, golly, there might've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends. Everybody had their own ""best"" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together. Um, and we would, had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls, Betty Belle, her dad had a VW Beetle, and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle. Did Betty Belle turn Catholic? No, huh-uh. She didn't? No. So we went out one night to the movie, but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to, and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen, and we didn't have chain pizza places like we do now, like Pizza Hut and all that. This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go. And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips. We would also drink water. So it wasn't a good situation for the waitresses, but we had fun and we didn't even think about it. We just did what we could get away with. Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time. So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in. And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me. And I just remember that movie was, had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and, what is it? Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is, where they're actual horror movies. This was, uh, a real intense, um, drama and, just very scary; kept you on the edge of your seat. And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us, and it wasn't just our group, but so many people in the theatre, they screamed out at one time. And that's really all I remember about that night, it was just a lot of fun. And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that, that I can remember going out with good friends.",0
"N_file00001.txt 2002-11-11 male 21 USA 1_12m Japanese, Spanish restaurant classroom landlord_advanced shopping_advanced invitation_advanced train station camping O K. I'm gonna start. Good afternoon. My name is XXX01. O K. Nice to meet you, XXX01. Nice to m. Er em. Er my name is XXX01. O K. O K. Can I call you XXX02? Yes. Go ahead, XXX01. How are how are you today, XXX02? I'm doing very well today. Erm I just got out of class, I just ate lunch and it's a beautiful day outside. I love this weather. Very sunny and quite warm for November. Yeah, it is quite warm. What did you have for lunch? Erm I had a obento with er rice and beef. It was pretty good. From the convenience store? Or? Oh no. It was actually from the school cafeteria. Ah. There's a school cafeteria here? Well er the school is very near to this this building. Ah O K. XXX03. It's within mm maybe five minutes walk. Oh I see. This is so what's this place for? Erm this is strictly for the er study-abroad students for the XXX04 program. Whereas. What about school? And the school is erm filled with Japanese students, and then there's another study-abroad program for erm some other students. <.> But this building is for XXX04 students only. O K. Now, I I really don't know anything about XXX04. Can you explain little about it? cough Erm well it's a study-abroad program. Er it doesn't focus only on language, but also erm I'm really participating in the culture. And so we're also er placed in internship situations where we get to do ethnographies of social organizations here in Japan. For instance, I'm placed in the XXX05. And I go there every week on Wednesday, and spend about <.> five hours doing translation and helping with office work, like stuffing envelopes and making copies. Eh uh the wh what is this institute involved in? Erm it's it's there for the community. Um XXX06 is a very diverse place. As far as Japan goes, there's a lot of foreigners living there, and so er the XXX05 helps to educate the Japanese about the other cultures, and helps to educate the other cultures about Japanese culture. And it's really interesting. But they they need a a lot of help with translations for the newsletters if they expect people to read them in English because everything is written in Japanese. Right. So I'm trying to help out with that. But my Japanese is <.> a bit slow. So I'm not helping too much. laughter Mm. I I'm sure you you are I'm sure you are. laughter Where do you originally come from, XXX02? I'm from XXX07 XXX08, XXX07, Ahh. in the United States. Pretty cold at this time of the year. Yes. It's already snowed there. laughter It's very cold there. Yeah. I've never erm been there. In fact, erm er in the winter, wha wha what do people do I mean how do they get through the winter? Well unlike Japan, er all the buildings are heated. They use a lot of central heating. And <.> so you're either in a warm bus or your warm car or you're inside a building that's heated. So unless you're walking outside, it's not very cold. But people wear large coats and a lot of clothing. And it's it's kind of dangerous to drive in the winter when there's a lot of snow on the roads. But people manage. Mm. Hm. Hm. This is much more comfortable. Yes. This is much more comfortable. But the cold here is very different. It's very dry in XXX07, and here, when it gets really cold, it almost seems like it sink it sinks through all of our clothing. Mh-hmm. I feel like it's almost colder. laughter I can understand that. O K. I'm gonna do some things with you today. Er first of all, I wanna show you a picture. O K. It's a picture of a restaurant. . And I'd like you to describe this picture in detail. O K. Well it looks like a very fancy restaurant where the waiter is dressed up in a tuxedo and he's serving wine to the customers who are also very dressed up in er <.> formal dresses and suits. There's a really big grandfather clock against the wall. And next to it, a woman playing the piano so it looks like there might be some very nice music. Erm they have a large selection of wine that the wai the waiter pushes around on a cart. And there are only three tables in this picture, and they look like they're really far apart. So maybe it helps people to have their own space and not have to listen to other people's conversations. laughter There's also a velvet rope that er seems to be blocking one of the entrances. And it almost looks like the entrance there's there's no door, like it goes straight outside. So maybe this is a very warm place to to have a restaurant. Erm I think the the woman needs her glass filled because her glass is empty while the man's glass is still got some wine in it. But she's probably struggling to decide which kind of wine she wants. Erm <.> the tables are really nice. They have nice white table clothes on them. And it doesn't look like this couple in the front of the picture has the food yet. So they must just be stopping by for drinks or maybe they wanted to start with wine. O K. O K. Thank you very much, XXX02. Er I guess you you found a er favorite restaurant, I don't know about around here, but in Tokyo somewhere. Mh-hmm. Can you tell me about that restaurant? cough Erm yes. In Shibuya, Or one of the place? there is a place where erm I like to get sushi where most of the plates are a hundred yen each. And you sit down, and it all goes around on a conveyer belt. And you have to eat at least seven hundred yen worth. But I usually eat much more than that. It's really, really good sushi, and it's really fast, and it's really cheap. And I really enjoy Shibuya. It's just because it's it's like a young fun place. So. There's tons of people there. And where I come from, we don't have cities that are that big. XXX08 is nowhere near the size of Tokyo. So. I see. What about the atmosphere? I mean, you you mentioned that it seems to be very spacious. I guess this place is pretty good. Wha what are the people like compared to to this kind of atmosphere? Well How's it feel like in this restaurant? cough well the people are definitely not dressed up in formal attire. The cooks wear aprons, and eh they're always busy making sushi, constantly putting the sushi together and putting it on plates and then putting the plates on the conveyer belt. While the people there's a time limit so the people are more focused on erm you know, stuffing their faces with sushi than actually having conversations with the people next to them. Plus, you're not at a table. You're at a bar that's around the conveyer belt. So it's really hard to have a conversation while you eat this food here. Erm it it is very crowded. There's not much room to move around. And I I think every time I go in there, I end up kicking someone or doing something stupid. And. Erm. Ho how did you find this place? Actually, my friends knew about it. They they took me there. Er I have some friends in Tokyo. And they like eating there because it's cheap and because they like sushi and it's a fun place to go. O K. Great. I have another picture to show you, XXX02. O K. It's a picture of a classroom. And again, I'd like you to describe this in detail for me. O K. Thank you. Well I never took calculus, but I think that's what the female teacher is teaching. And she looks like she's paying a lot of attention to the board while there's only one student in the classroom who is actually paying attention to her. Erm there are some girls talking in the back. One of the boys in the back is drinking pop while he listens to his headphones. Er one of the girls is playing with her cellular phone. And another really macho-looking guy is blowing a bubble with his gum while he sits and looks cool next to the window. I think he is looking out the window. Maybe there is something interesting out there. But erm it doesn't really look like an American-style classroom. I'm guessing it's Japan. But I don't I haven't been in a lot of Japanese classrooms. Erm <.> there are a lot of windows. And it like, it looks like when you go out the door, you go straight outside, which is very different from any school I've been to. Erm the students, despite the fact that they are not working on homework or listening, most of them, they all have books out in front of them. Except for one of the girls who's talking in the back who's got a bunch of makeup. She must be painting her nails. And <.> they look young, but they almost look like college-age students. And they are all wearing <.> normal clothes. They're not wearing er uniform. They're all dressed very differently. O K. XXX02, you mentioned that you didn't think it was America. Um in what ways is this classroom different from classrooms that you er were in when you were a student yeah, a high school student? Hm. Well the <.> it looks like the teacher is raised up on a little platform here. And what else? <..> I guess the differences are that different. There are little hooks on the desks here that I've never seen before. And the cellular phone she is using is very Japanese looking because in America, those are really expensive and very rare. laughter laughter So I guess it could be either. But it it's not much like a classroom I've ever done in. Oh what was what was the atmosphere in your classroom like when you were younger. Erm well when I was in high school, and this is XXX07, so it's very cold. But we would never have a classroom where if you step out the door of the classroom, you are outside. It's always <.> an indoor hallway. And you have to find an entrance or an exit for the building. Erm the classrooms, they seem a lot bigger than the one in the picture. Erm <.> the desks us usually didn't have room to <.> to put anything into. They were just desks that were attached to a chair. And erm tsk I don't know, the kids usually paid attention except for a few in the back. sniff And we didn't have to wear uniforms to school because it was a public school. So I don't know how else it was different. Yeah. O K. That much. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. O K, XXX02, I'm gonna change a little bit now. I wanna do a role-play. O K. I want you to imagine this scenario here. O K. Erm a window in your apartment was broken. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K. You understand that? Yes. O K. I'm gonna play the part of the building manager. O K. O K? And we'll do it on this telephone. O K. O K. Hello? Er this is XXX01 here. Good morning. Hey, XXX01, this is XXX02. I'm sorry. I'm up in erm Room four-ten. I was just wondering, you know, I have this broken window in my room, and I was wondering if I can get it fixed er as soon as possible. Er the fo the window is broken? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Erm it's got a a big chunk missing out of it. It it seems that erm you know, one of our neighborhood kid's probably threw a ball at it or maybe a rock or something. I don't know how it broke. But it it's broken, and it's letting a draft in, and I don't want any birds in my room or anything like that. So is there any way you could come up here and fix it today? Erm well I don't know about today. Maybe well Wednesday, Thursday? Ooh. <.> Wow. Erm that's really late. laughter I I don't know. It there's absolutely no time you can come up today? Hm. Er I'm really busy right now. Hmm. Yeah, the weather's fine. Shouldn't be a problem. Er hm. Wednesday or Thursday, huh? You can just put some tape over it, maybe. I guess I could. Keep the birds out. Urm. laughter Er what time what time on Wednesday are you free to come get come fix it? Well er even Wednesday, I can't really guarantee it. You know, I'm not I'm kind of busy. Hmm. Huh. Well wh what are you doing right now? Er watchin er the you know, I'm er watching the game on T V. Oh O K. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was watching that, too. But but er I I got a kind of cold because the there's a hole in my window. laughter Um you know, er I'm I'm actually recording the game right now. If you wanna come up, we could just watch it later. I could I could help you to see whatever you missed. Erm is is that O K? Urm Could you come up and fix it right now? I could yeah, I could well I could fix it temporarily. Erm. But I don't have any glass. Really? Ho you know, how how would you get glass? Like what? Well you'd have to call up up the er the the building contractor for that. Oh O K. Eh. I can do that. O K. But it would have to be Wednesday or Thursday. O K. Well why don't you come up right now and and fix the window and and then we can talk about the building contractor later? O K. I'll watch the game. O K. O K. Thank you. Sounds good. O K. Thank you. That's the end of the role-play. laughter You miss American sports? Mm? Um a little bit in the fall. I I'm not a really big sports fan, but I did enjoy going to er my college football games and just hanging out with everyone and seeing everyone get excited when our team was winning and getting mad when our team was losing. I think it's more it's less about the sport, more about just er coming together as like a school. Hm. But er yeah, I miss I miss going to the football games. Well I have never been to a football game in my life. laughter As you can imagine as a American football game. Right. Um can you explain to me um you you talked about the the atmosphere of the team. Mh-hmm. Can you explain to me how that can affect people how it affects people? Well um. It's not the game, it's the atmosphere. Yeah. The our school is very large. I think there is about sixty thousand students in the XXX09. Wow. And so when we have football games there in the Metro Dome, it's kind of like the Tokyo Dome, it's about that size, and we don't fill up the whole place, but there's a lot of people that attend, a lot of people that are students and also people who aren't students. And er people get very passionate about the game and about you know, if if they think the coach is doing something wrong, they'll be yelling at at the coach. And erm there's usually a little souvenirs that are given out to people um to wave around and to help cheer on the team. It's very, very loud. And there's usually a lot of people drinking beer and eating nachos. And um most of the people wear XXX09 colors and shirts. And some people wear hats. And er the mascot which is a a gopher, erm he he runs around, laughter and gets people all excited. And then whenever we er score a touchdown or make any points, he he does as many push-ups as we have points. And people get really excited about that. And then sometimes they they take a cannon, and they they shoot like erm shirts, Ahm. different paraphernalia, I guess, into the crowd and people really enjoy that. It's a real show-biz Yeah. situation. Great. Yeah. O K. I'd like to do another role-play with you. O K. This one's about shopping. If you can read that for me. <.> laughter The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? Uhm this one is face-to-face . O K. O K. Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you? Yes. Erm you know, I I just purchased er this shirt. And basically, I bought this shirt because I thought it was gonna go with er these pants that I already own. Because the colors looked like they would go together. But it it turns out that they totally clash. You know, it's really, really bad together. And you know, I just bought it, you know, maybe five hours ago. And I brought it home, and now I'm back because er I I'd like to exchange it. I. Well you er basically, so we have a policy against exchanges as you know. O K. What is that? Ah that's just a store policy. It's written it was written on the on the door. Well I mean, it still has all the tags on it except for the security tag that they took off. So you could easily just put it back on that shelf if you wanted to. Well Is that a possibility? yeah, it's it's possible, I guess. But er I mean the the colors don't change in five hours. You knew the color when you bought it. Right, right, right. Yeah, I understand that. But I I think I I really didn't realize the exact color of the pants and how how they would look together because they do look really bad. And eh I mean I see other stuff in this store that I really would like to exchange for. So it wouldn't be like you are m losing money. You could change the pants. I mean Oh that's true. does it have to be that pair? Well really like these pants. And pants are much more expensive than shirts. So laughter I'd really prefer to exchange it for something else in this store because, you know, I I know exactly what I want. And er it's actually it's it's more expensive. So I think it would help you guys more if I if I were able to exchange and just pay the difference. Er give us a little paper work though. <.> O K. You'd have to deduct the original and then add this all again. Mh-hmm. Maybe something exactly the same price would be possible. Hmm. You know, that would be fine as long as <.> as long as I could do that. I I the the colors really look bad together. I'm so I'm sorry that, you know, I have to ur inconvenience you this way. But, you know, I wouldn't come back unless I had to. O K. Well so well you'd better have a look around and try to find something that's same size, same price. O K. Thank you very much. If you can, I think we can do that. O K. Thank you. I'm sorry. O K, thank you very much. laughter O K. What kind of things have you bought so far Erm. in Japan since you've been here? laughter I bought clothes. Once it started getting colder, I didn't bring enough long-sleeve shirts. Ah. Uh-huh-huh. So I've been shopping around for clothes. And although I'm in Japan, I've only been really shopping at the Gap, because they have these sale racks where the prices just fall so quickly. And they sell stuff for so cheap, and I really needed sweaters. So I bought like three sweaters and pair of pants, few other things. How do you decide, generally speaking not only in Japan, generally speaking, how do you decide when you buy something? Erm. What factors? I think <.> the first is, ""Do I like it? Does it look good?"" Erm ""Will it go with the other clothes I own?"" Um the next is, ""Can I afford it?"" And ""Is it a good deal, or could I find the same thing for less somewhere else?"" And so, so far in Japan, I've been able to find really good um sales really good deals here. How do you find the service compare to your stores? Erm well the service seems to be much more formal, much more polite. It's it's hard to say if the service is better because my Japanese isn't good enough for people to really help me out. But it seems like <.> you know, you don't you don't get the complaining complaining employees like you would in the States. laughter So people seem to be much nicer and much more ready to help. Can you can you give me an er er an example of one of those complaining employee from your experience? Oh wow. Too many to think about, I guess. But laughter wa one that sticks out. Well it really depends on the stores you go to. But if you go to a store generally, the stores with the best prices have the worst service. And so erm maybe not clothing. But like if you go to McDonald's, people are horrible, like they don't you can just tell that they don't wanna be there and they don't really wanna help you. And, you know, they may call you, ""Sir,"" but they they kind of mumble. If you don't understand them the first time, they get really mad. While here, um you know, I walk into McDonald's, and they're they talk to me very formally and they're always smiling. And even though like I don't understand what they say sometimes, they always help me out. It's very nice. I I enjoy the service here a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. O K. We have one more role-play O K. to to do. Uh er. O K? It's er an invitation there. I mm er want you to read that. O K. The interviewee is reading the card. Hmm. O K? <.> O K. You understand? Yeah. O K. And this is on the telephone. Hello? Hey, how's it going? This is XXX02. Oh XXX02. I'm so sorry I missed the the party the other night. I'm really, really sorry. Um my car broke down. My battery is shot. I need to get a new one. And I wasn't able to er to make it to your place. I'm really sorry about that. It it's not like it's a million miles away. Right, right, right. But you know, I mean, I I can't just walk there and I don't have a bike or anything. So, yeah, I I couldn't make it. You could've called. Oh mm eh. I'm really sorry, but I mean, I needed my car the next morning, so I was working and trying to get a battery and trying to find some way to to get in touch with er an automeric auto mechanic or something to to get my car working again. So I'm I'm really sorry. It totally slipped my mind. But to take five minutes out and you can't call me? Mm. Yeah, tha that's true. I mean, I could have. But I I w I w. I mean we could have picked you up and wouldn't be the problem. Aw. But I didn't wanna <.> make you miss your own party. I mean. Well er maybe I wouldn't have come but you know, there were also a lot of people here. They were waiting. Right, right, right. They were kind of expecting to see you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. laughter I'm so sorry about this. Erm but but really, it had to be taken care of that night because you I mean you know how it is. I needed my car in the morning. If if I'm gonna go to work uh I can't take the bus. I I mean I I'd never make it on time. So. I mean you you do understand, right? Well er I I I I've heard better excuses. laughter O K. laughter But sure. I mean, er how was the car? D' you get it fixed? Yes, yes, yes. I er I got a hold of a mechanic. Great guy. Erm old friend from high school. And he he actually looked up the kind of battery I needed, and he brought it out that night at, you know, eleven P. M. S really went out his way to help me out. But, you know, those things aren't cheap. Really cost me I mean er like but yeah. My car is working again. And I made it to work and got everything done. O K. Well we missed you at this party. Yeah. I'm so sorry about that. We'll we'll we'll get together soon. <.> O K. O K. laughter Well I hope your car works next time. laughter O K. Thank you very much. O K. That's the end of the last role-play. O K. laughter You have a car back in the States? Yes. Yes. Er I have a car and my parents just called me to tell me that my car is dying and eh it probably won't be there when I get back. Because I put it in their care, and erm they my my parents use it every once in a while. And it was acting up, and they found out that the steering was bad. And it's an old car. It's ten years old, and it's got over two hundred thousand miles on it which I don't even know what that is in kilometers. It's a Toyota. Right. So. Why why did you buy such a car in the first place? Well actually, I got it from my uncle at a very, very good price. And Toyotas are amazing cars. I mean, they they really put on the miles. And it's been a great car. It's it's hardly had any problems. It it's got a V six, so it's pretty fast. And it's a Camry, so it's got a lot of room even for a Japanese car. You know, the the cars in America tend to be a lot bigger, but it's er I really love that car, and I hate to hear that it's doing so badly. And I really I'm gonna be disappointed when I go back and. Maybe you go to a funeral when you get back. Yeah. laughter My parents have taken it to the junkyard. laughter O K. laughter O K. Next , but I want to show you a a series of pictures. Uh O K. O K? Er going from one to six here. Mh-hmm. One, two, three, four, five, six. And I want you to make up a story from these pictures. O K. O K? Going from one to six. Make up a story. But this happened before. So I want to start your story, ""One day last week"", and then go. O K. O K? So one day last week, I was er I was on my way to school, and I just got to the station. And I mean, you know how the station is in the mo morning. It's so crowded. People are everywhere. And er I got a really nice spot right up by erm the the front of the plat plat er the platform so that I'll be able to get on the train and perhaps even get a seat. But er as there was this guy next to me who was talking and he was waving his arms around, his arm bumped into me, and I dropped my briefcase under the train tracks. And so I turned around to this guy. I was like, ""What are you thinking? Like look at uh how crowded it is. Would you get off waving your arms around like that?"". And he's l you know, he apologize and he is looking down at the the briefcase and he was like, ""Oh I'm so sorry."". But erm just then, you know, you hear, ""Mamonaku yonban-senni,"" you know, and this train comes by. It totally just ran over my briefcase, and I w I was freaking out. And I I couldn't get on my train. And and so I just waited there. And when it left, the train had just passed over my briefcase, like it hadn't destroyed it. I hadn't ran it over really. It just glided over it. And so I was really, really relieved. And erm luckily, we we got a hold of um one of the workers at the station there, and he he got down on the tracks and he grabbed my briefcase and gave it back to me. And I was able to go to work. And actually made it er on time even though I missed my first train. So, exciting day. O K. Thank you very much. O K. XXX02 what's the er most curious or funniest thing that you've seen on the train Oh. so far? Um the funniest thing on a train. Or most interesting, most curious. I think just seeing people pile into your train, like not caring how crowded it is. They they all get on, and everyone is squished together. I think that the first time I saw that, I was really amazed. And then one time, I was coming back from Tokyo one night. And er you know, all there were all these people coming back from the bars and all these company workers. And it was really, really packed. And then after some of the people got off, somebody actually threw up on the train. And I didn't even noticed that. I just saw someone bend over. And then later on, more people cleared up. I saw this big pile on the ground where no one was standing. It was so gross. But I think that's one of the most peculiar things I've seen on the train so far. laughter laughter It happens, it happens. Yeah. O K. One more thing I'd like to show you. I'd like to er another sequence of pictures. One more story to make up here. O K. O K, XXX02. Again, from one to six. O K. Please make up a story. Hmm. And again, this happened before. So we'll start with, ""One day last week"". And then go. So it's supposed to be me? Er it can be you, yeah, but it doesn't really look like you, so Yeah. uh laugther as you as you like. O K. So um one day last week, my my two friends, er Michiko and Keiko decided that they were g both gonna go on a camping trip. And so they grabbed all their camping gear, and they piled it into their car. And um they made their way out to some camp grounds over by Mount Fuji. And cough they er they started getting everything ready. They built a fire, started cooking food for the night, erm started putting up the tent, and really getting ready to to stay there for a while. And all the sudden, it started raining. And er unfortunately, they hadn't watched the the weather ur er the weather station to see <.> what was going on with it. But er they ended up being a really bad um typhoon and a thunderstorm. All their stuff got blown away in the high winds. And they just they just went in their car. They wer they were so afraid that they were gonna get struck by a lightning or something. They they drove all the way to erm this hotel called Ho Hotel Cosmos about a half an hour away. They ended up staying there in the mountains, in a hotel instead of camping outside for their er their weekend vacation. O K. Thank you very much. Now, I know that up in er XXX07, it's nice and natural all this nature around. Eh. laughter Tell me about one trip you've taken to the great outdoors. Yeah. Erm well. Could be camping or in the lodges or something. Yeah. I I went up to there is a city in northern XXX07 right by a XXX10. And er there's a city called XXX11. It's it's a pretty big city, but it's it's kind of old. And er passed XXX11 is er place called XXX12. And I stayed in a lodge there right on XXX10. And it is a really enormous lake. I took a lot of walks around the rocks there. I got to ur just enjoy the scenery that you don't get when you are living in the city. Hm. So it was really nice. The weather was very nice. It was er it was spring, but the spring in XXX07 is a lot like the wind winter in Tokyo. So it's pretty cold. What did you actually do beyond Erm. taking walks? I guess I I didn't really do that much in the great outdoors. It was mostly erm kind of a small-town atmosphere. You know, go to the local er bar, go to the local restaurants. And er I went to er a microbrewery and got to taste some of the local beer there. Um this place called XXX12 Brewing Company. They have a a very, very good stout they have a good red beer and a special ale that I really like. Erm tsk what else? Oh eh I went skiing because there there are some hills up there. And it was it was still pretty cold out. So I got to go skiing in the hills there. Hm. Apart from apart from Japan, Mh-hmm. have you been abroad at all? Not really. I've been to Canada a few times, but Doesn't count. Yeah. That doesn't count. laughter Because they speak English. So this is your first time? Really. This is. Ur I've been to Japan once before, but this is the only place I've been. O K. What was when you first came to Japan, er what was your impression? Erm my impression was <.> I think I was really expecting it to be even more different than it was. Hm hm. Hm. At least at face value, I just saw a lot of the Western influence. And I saw a lot of erm like English words everywhere. And, yeah, I'm studying Japanese back in school. And so I I found it kind of disappointing that I I couldn't practice um all the signs because they all had translations on them. But I think that was my first impression of, say Narita Airport and Tokyo which is, I mean there is a large Western influence as opposed to, if you go to the more erm traditional place as Kyoto and other other places where it's not all city and there aren't a lot of foreigners. It's more traditional. But I think also just the size of everything, things tend to be a lot smaller and laughter very expensive. And and yet. Except Gap. Yeah, except the Gap. laughter The Gap is cheap and electronics are cheap. I can't believe how cheap cell phones are here. The kind of cell phone I own right now <.> would cost upwards of three or four hundred dollars in the States while it cost me about three thousand yen here. Right. And I I I can't believe it. Right. Erm you m you mentioned that you use pick Japanese as your major. I'm interested why why did you pick Japanese as your major? Well I I didn't really know what I wanted to do after school. And so I figured, whatever I decided to do if I really I love languages and I'm studying Spanish as well. Hm. But ur I figured whatever I decided to do would help to make me more marketable er if I were to do business or actually be an interpreter. And plus, I could I could change, and I could um I could make it more of a sociology focus, and do ethnography in another country, and be able to live with people. Eh I I felt like it left me with a lot of options. And plus, it's really the only thing I wanted to study when I got into college. And I've kind of changed my mind since I've studied more of the general classes, because in the States, we have to take we still have to take science classes and things at a liberal art school. And I really I wish I would have studied more science. I wish I I could venture more into economics and eh you get a minor in that. But er it really, er I just I love language, I love being able to communicate with people. Hm. Yeah. Except the sushi shop where there's no time for Yeah, yeah. communicating. Right. Exactly. O K. laughter We're pretty much at the end of the interview now, then. O K. Eh. Er tonight Mh-hmm. uh sorry, this afternoon, you you've got any more classes, or you can just go home now? I'm done with classes. I'm free to go home. But er I need to stick around and do more homework. That's pretty conscientious. Yeah. Where is where is home? Anywhere around here? Yeah. It's it's actually only two stops away from here. It's er XXX13 Station. Oh oh oh oh. That's the stop, and I live about a twenty-minute walk away from there. So it's kind of convenient except for the twenty-minute walk. It's gonna get cold. Yeah. That twenty-minute walk. Yeah, yeah. laughter But to today is pretty nice out. So. Yeah, it is nice today. more like January, February, Oh yeah. that twenty-minute walk is gonna seem long. Definitely. laughter Definitely <.> will be a long one. O K. Well thank you very much for your time today. Oh thank you. Thank you very much, XXX02. That's the end of the interview then. O K. Thank you.",0

Urm this past February and March, I added my second major which is international studies urm because I wasn't exactly sure that I wanted to do music as a profession.

O K. So first thing today, please describe this picture for me. O K. Urm this looks to me like either a dormitory room or a room in a house, a bedroom. Urm there is a girl sitting at a desk in front of her computer. Urm there are two animals. One is a cat sleeping on the bed. And a dog is sleeping on the floor next to the bed. There is a rather large stereo system in the back of the room with two speakers. Above it is a calendar showing a month of June. Urm the stereo sits on top of the bookshelf urm that holds fairly a fairly good amount of books and a telephone. Urm <.> on the girl's desk, there is also a typewriter next to her computer. Ur and the desk is front of a window. O K. laughter So why do you think she has both computer and the typewriter next to each other? Mhm. Well urm nowadays, ur a lot of students access the internet for information. Urm the computer could be used for internet access as well as word processing or writing papers. Urm the typewriter, ur <.> typewriter could also be used for writing papers if she does not own a printer. Ur. laughter O K. laughter laughter O K. So ur do you live with your host family or are you living alone? I'm actually living alone in a dormitory. Mm. Could you tell me more about that dorm? Ur yes. It's in Barakinakayama on the Tozai sen. And urm <.> I live on the third floor. My room is fairly it's fairly large urm for a single room. It came with bed, urm closet, desk, ur dresser drawers and um a sink and mirror, cabinets. Um <.> we also have a balcony outside the window where we can um hang our laundry. Ur the windows ur go all the way to the floor. It's like a like a sliding glass door. Hm. Um we also have air conditioning units, heat. Um they are very nice, actually. Um when I came, I didn't really know what to expect. So when I when I urm finally settled down in my dorm, you know, it's ve it's very comfortable. So. Hm. Yeah. All right. So here's another picture. O K. Please ur describe this picture. O K. Ur this looks to me like a residential neighborhood. Urm a couple of houses are spaced pretty far apart, actually. Urm it doesn't look crowded at all. Urm there's a car parked on the street, and some ladies are talking. One looks like she's walking a dog. Urm a man across the street sitting on the bench is reading a newspaper. Urm there are a couple of kids out on the front lawn of <.> this house are playing. Two are playing catch with a ball. And another is skipping jump rope by herself. Ur it looks to be a very sunny day. Ur ur there's a man jogging down the street. Urm everybody seems to be enjoying themselves and urm participating in their various recreational activities. laughter O K. So I got the . Uh-huh. laughter So what kind of recreational activities ur do you enjoy in Japan? Urm in Japan? Ur sometimes I like to travel urm even if it's just to be other side of Tokyo. Ur I enjoy urm visiting new places, urm seeing new things, urm learning you know, getting to know like why they're important to either the country of Japan or that particular area. Urm other than that, ur I like relaxing. laughter laughter Urm watching movies, spending time with my friends, urm keeping in touch back at home. Ah I see. Yeah. How do you keep in touch with your family? Urm I actually brought a personal computer with me to Japan, and the dormitory offers internet access for a special fee urm an additional fee each month. Urm so I keep in touch through e-mail, instant messenger. Sometimes my parents call me. Oh I see. O K. laughter All right. And you mentioned you've been to many places around here. Mh-hmm. Ur where is the most interesting place for you? Uhm. Urm I probably would have to say mmm I think it was Takayama, <.> maybe. Mm. Well actually, no, I changed my mind. Urm I visited Midorinomura. I think it was in Nagano, Uh-huh. maybe. Um I went there with a bunch of people from a different program I was I was on at the time. Um they were all from America. And we met many ur Japanese college students who were around our age. And we got to spend the weekend there with them. Urm we did all kinds of activities, urm played sports together. We had barbecue together. And ur we went to an onsen together. Wow. laughter Yeah. It it was it was very enjoyable. That was probably my best memory, I think in Japan. Oh well sounds awfully fun. Yeah. laughter laughter All right. O K. So next, let's try a role-play. O K. Please read this card, and when you're ready, I'll begin. The interviewee is reading the card. Ready? O K. O K. May I help you, ma'am? Ur yes. I'm looking for an apartment. O K. All right. So what kind of place do you want to live in? Well I would like to find a place that's not too noisy. Mh-hmm. Urm I'm looking for neighbors who ur respect, you know, others, and uh but but yet who are friendly. laughter Uh-huh. Urm I'm looking for let's see, sigh urm if if it's possible, I would like an apartment that is fully furnished. Urm. Hmm. O K. We have a nice apartment Mh-hmm. ur near Ichikawa Station. Mhm. How would you like that? Ichikawa Station. Urm that's that's relatively close. Urm I actually work in Funabashi shi. So urm yeah, actually that would work for me. O K. Thank you. Urr it's going to be ten minutes walk from the station. O K. Is it O K? That is fine. All right. And I don't know much about the neighbors in that apartment. laughter laughter What should I do? Urm well it's not really that important. O K. But laughter laughter I mean I c I can find out for myself, you know, when I go and visit. But. All right. So I think I can take you there now. Oh really? Yeah. O K. All right. So would you like to see it now? I would very much. All right. O K. I'll take you there. O K. Thank you. Thank you. This is the end of the role-play. O K. All right. So have you ever ha uh have you ever found your own apartment? No. No? Hm. So you lived with your family Mh-hmm. in the United States? Yes. Here, how did you find the place? You're living in a dorm? Yes. And how was it coordinated? Urm it was coordinated actually through the I E S program. When we applied to study abroad urm through I E S, urm there is actually a lady who takes care of housing for all of us. She finds urm she finds host families for those who choose to live with a host family. And there's actually a a couple of dorms that they've been using that I E S has been using um for the past few years that worked out really well. So I was placed in one of those. Mhm. So why have you decided to live alone rather than living with your host family? Well originally, cough urm when I started to apply, I wanted to live with a host family. But then I was a little torn between the two. I didn't urm I wasn't sure because both seemed, you know, like they had their benefits, but both I think had drawbacks, too. Urm eventually, the more I thought about it, I thought that I'd probably benefit more well not benefit more, but I'd probably be better off living in a dorm urm <.> especially with my studying. Like, it is kind of important to me um to be able to um have that study time and um to get things done. Ur I think with a host family, like I wouldn't wanna spend too much time with them. And that wouldn't work. laughter laughter Um laughter I know that sounds so bad.

Very believable on screen. Mm. Yeah. So which is your favorite movie of Tome Hanks? Of Tom Hanks, urm mm I liked him a lot in ""Cast Away"". Mhm. Yeah. Why? Just because he was basically, he was almost the only person in that movie. laughter laughter You know? And just to do all the stuff that he did, you know, he has laughter he he has nobody to to play off off, you know, a dialogue. And just him. And you know, all his like what he does and. I think I just think he did a really good job. O K. Sorry, that's a stupid question to ask. laughter laughter O K. All right. There's another picture. O K. There are six pictures this time. And please make up a story based on these six pictures. O K. O K. One day last week, urm a housewife, her name was Mira, she looked at her fridge, and she saw that ""We have no food."" So she decides to go shopping. She drives to the grocery store to the supermarket. Parks her car, gets out, and goes in. She takes out her huge list of food, and proceeds to shop. She goes down each isle, and she takes one thing off the shelf after another one after another, and fills her cart. When she finishes, she takes her cart to the cashier, and checks out of the supermarket. After leaving, she pushes her sh her shopping cart back to her cart, opens the trunk, and loads her groceries in the back, feeling very good about herself because she just bought food for her family. laughter So she goes home, unpacks her groceries, and puts them all away where they belong. Puts on her apron, goes to the stove, and proceeds to make breakfast. O K. O K. Thank you. laughter So how do you usually have dinner? Urm in Japan? Mm-hm. Um actually, we we paid for a meal plan ur when coming here. And we eat in the shokudou Hm. downstairs. How's the food? It's very good. Urm it's actually kind of nice. Ur it almost feels like we have a home cooked meal, laughter you know. Japanese style? Yeah. Oh really? Mm-hm. Mhm. Some sometimes they cook a little bit more western style food. And you know, for breakfast, they give you a choice like a western dish and a Japanese dish everyday. But dinner is usually almost always um Japanese style. What's your favorite Japanese food or dish? Urm that would have to be tempura. Mhm. Tempura ga daisuki. laughter laughter Did you try tempura in the United States, too? Urm yes. Yes, there is actually ur quite a few Japanese restaurants around where I'm from. And I tried it there. And it's actually pretty good in America. But here, it's the best. laughter laughter O K. Do you cook for yourself? Urm not usually. Um here, no. Urm I don't I don't really have time ur most of the time. At home, sometimes, but I don't cook very much. laughter laughter I don't know how to cook very much. I make a few things. Uh-huh. But urm I'd like to learn more. My mom says, you know, she's gonna teach me more. Uh-huh. She cooks a lot. laughter So why are you so busy here? Well urm my commute to school everyday is about an hour including walking. Urm so I get up in the morning, I leave at usually at eight to come to school by nine or nine-twenty. Urm I'm at school most um most of the days, I'm at school until maybe four or five depending on what I'm doing. Urm and then I go home. I don't get home until like six or seven. And then I eat, and then I have to study. So it's like I try to find time, you know, to relax and time for myself. But sometimes it's kind of hard because I have so much work to do all the time. Yeah. So what subject is the hardest one for you? Urm I probably have to say history. Japanese history? History of Tokyo. Oh maybe you know much more than me. I doubt that. Well it's it's hard. I mean because our sensei gives us so much reading to do. It takes a long time to do. Plus it's kind of skipping around a little bit. Like we study mostly the Edo period, but within the Edo period, we kind of rapping laughter you know, skip around a little bit. And it's not exactly as orderly. We could follow a process or series of of events. You know, that's easier to remember. So it's a little hard. Sometimes it gets confusing, and it gets jumbled up in your head. laughter So. Why does he do that? I don't know. laughter I I mean, I guess in a way, it's it's kind of organized, but it's not like it's not textbook organized. You know, when you have like chronological dates. You know that this happened here, this happened here. And it's like we read about, you know, different things like different aspects of the Edo culture and the people, and how transportation evolved during the Meiji restoration, and going out of the Edo period. And laughter it it's just kind of confusing sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. O K. All right. Thank you. We have come to almost the end. O K. So can you go home now, or do you have to take another class? Urm actually, it's Thursday so I am finished with classes for the day. Urm but I think I'll be sticking around. Ur some of my friends and I are going to be studying together for our history mid-term that is on Monday. Ohh O K. So. laughter Oh mid-term? Mm-hm. All right. So when is the last day for ur the term? The term I think ends on December twentieth, I believe. That's the end of final's week. Uh-huh. Are you going back to Chicago? Maybe no. You're going to stay here? I would likes to, but yeah, actually I'm gonna go back to Chicago. I leave actually on the twenty-first of December. laughter Urm ur that's the er that's when I booked my flight, because we we have to be out of the dorm by the twenty second. Uhh O K. Ur that's what I E S said. So I'm leaving on the twenty-first, and I'm going back to Chicago. And um that was also my choice because I wanted to be home for Christmas Hmm. urm because that's pretty much the biggest holiday for my family. Mh-hmm. So. And it'd be a really good chance for me to see my family again. Ur you know, everybody in may family, laughter you know. And I also wanted ur a little bit of a break before I go back to school for spring because I only have maybe two weeks before that. Oh O K. It's not bad. Yeah. O K. All right. Thank you very much for coming. And Thank you. have a nice Christmas with your family. Ohh thank you very much. laughter laughter Thank you.",0

Er XXX04. Yeah. I've ne I don't know anywhere around here. It's the first time for me. Yeah, O K. What's it like around here? Er it's <.> typical XXX05, you know, suburb of Tokyo. Er three quarters of this city is built on reclaimed land. Erm that's how they became a a city. Er it was reclaimed land and putting people there. Erm it's on XXX06 sen which is uh very typical er it's actually a subway line. Runs out XXX07 and to XXX05. A very typical pack-them-in in-the-morning subway line where I'm going in the other direction. So. So it's pretty empty for you. Yeah, it's pretty empty for me. I I always have a seat. Erm and I watch people, you know, getting pushed into the train on the other side of the tracks. laughter Good for you. laughter Good for you if you don't have a guilty conscious about that. No. I I I I ride it towards the city one day a week. So, yeah, o on Wednesdays, I'm I'm getting, you know, pushed into the train. O K. Can I ask what do you have to do on Wednesday? Ah on Wednesday, I go down to XXX08 er to do a field placement. Er I I work down at XXX08 one day a week. Oh. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. How did you Ah that's get into that? er through XXX09. Hm. Ah that's part of the program. What what are your responsibilities there? Er essentially none. Erm. O K. I I I go there. Eh I just kind of hag out. Erm go to the meetings, er just watch stuff. What is there to watch? Er past week, I went to a Foreign Relations er Committee hearing. Er watched that. It's in Japanese, right? Yeah, in Japanese. Yeah. Erm I I I can't uh I honestly, I can't understand most of it. Er but ur I unders understand bits and pieces Hm. Hm. Hm. er o of what's going on. Erm and so I I I've got a general general idea o of of what they are talking about. Right. Er. From the schools, you what's the what's the point of it? Er from from the schools, you i it's to see Japanese people in action. Er it's is i it's part of our class called Social Organization in Japan. Er but essentially, it's just to see Japanese people in real life er er at i i in the work place as opposed to in a bar on the weekends. Hm. Hm. Hm hm hm. Yeah. But XXX08 is a rather unusual work place than I would imagine. Er i i i it's it's different. Erm i i it's not it's not a typical business. Yeah. Can you er talk about as differences as you perceived them? Erm er i i the offices are just er very small. Erm so you don't have the typical, like desks set up. Hm. Erm a a and and th and the boss, you know, the XXX08 members, more than just bosses, almost a God within the office that that everyone er can avows to. <..> Interesting. Yeah. How did you if I may ask, how did you get involved in this program in the first place? Er just through my university er back on XXX10. Erm I I just signed up, fill out the application, got accepted. Er and here I am. What's the secret erm recipes of how getting accepted? Er being able to pay the tuition. Oh. Yeah. That's about it? That's about it. Yeah. At least you have to have er at least a three-point of G P A. Erm and er tha that's essentially on the requirement. No no language requirement? No language requirement. How have you managed to pick up Japanese? Er I I've I I I'm constantly amazed at how much my Japanese actually helps me. Erm because I I I didn't know a a any any Japanese before I came here. Er a a and every day, I'm constantly constantly amazed a a a at the Japanese I can use. Erm er then I go home to my host parents, and and I feel stupid erm because they s my host mom would speak to me in in Japanese and then spea say the same thing in in English. Erm so i it helps me out. But I I just don't erm er a lot of it I er there's so much more for me to understand I'm sure. how. Yeah. They have been here a lot. Yeah. Yeah. O K. First of all, I'd like to show you a map. Yeah. I'd like you to describe this. <.> Well ur describe what you see here. Er it's a map of a school, er bank offices, zoo, ur apartment building, restaurant, hospital, public library, bookstore, post office, er bus station, supermarket, movie theaters. Er there's the South River. Erm there's roads er and a train station in the upper left-hand corner, and then the North River on the top part of er the picture. Er. What's your impression of this town? Er my impression is that it's very residential community. Erm and there there seems to be a lot of trees, er but at the same time, there also seems to be a lot of train lines running into it. So I imagine it's, you know, suburban community er where most people would commute into the city. Hm. Hm. Hm. Were you er uh I'm sorry, where do you actually live in the States? Er XXX11. In XXX11. Yeah. So that is very different from from this. Er I I live in the suburbs of XXX11. Erm. O K. Er public transportation in XXX11 is very poor. Er there the there is a very limited public transportation system. Hm. Er especially when it comes to the suburbs, er every everyone has to drive in the suburbs. Er even if you want to take the train into the city, er you have to drive to the train station. Hmm. Er nearest train station from my house is up three miles. Hmm. Er so i yo you have to erm I mean the nearest bus route is couple miles away. Er public transportation is er it's completely unfeasible laughter er to to use as means to get around. So to go downtown, you drive. You drive. Yeah. But I would imagine, I have never been to XXX11, but from I remember, er parking is a problem. How do you how do you find a parking space? Er you you pay ten dollars and park in a garage. <.> Yeah. Or or or you drive around for an endless amount of time er circling the same block looking for a parking spot er <.> which is cheaper. But, yeah, on the other hand, it takes forever. Right. I see. Er you know, it's it's typical new American city. You know, it wasn't designed for for cars. So the streets are small, narrow. Er. of surprise if there're like the transportation systems. Yeah. Yeah. I it it's very er <.> the the there's lots of public er parking. Like there's plenty of parking garages. You can always there there is always plenty of space Hm. in the parking garages ju just not necessarily on the street. Right. Er. Then there goes ten dollars for renting out. Yeah. You have to have ten dollars ten to fifteen dollars er to park for the day. Hmm. But now you live in er XXX03. How how is the area that you live with your host family different from the area in the suburbs of XXX11? Er mm now I I I can get anywhere I want by public transportation. Hm. Er the the subway station is er about five-minute walk from my house. Hm. Er to get here to school, it's about fifteen-minute walk from the train station. Erm which at home, if I were to walk to the train station, it would take me forty-five minutes, one hour. Erm <.> how everything I need is within walking distance or or within biking distance. Er post office, er the store, er getting my hair cut, a anyth anything I need is is right around the corner er a as opposed to in XXX11 er the XXX11 suburbs where you'd have to drive for all of that. Erm there is no <.> s ur er just recently, they built a shopping center next to my house. But even that is a fifteen-minute walk to to get to, Next to your house, right. yeah, yeah, yeah next to. Hm. laughter Er. O K. I understand. O K. I'd like to show you a picture of a restaurant next, XXX02. I'd like you to describe this er restaurant in detail. Er this restaurant, er there is a woman in the back playing the piano er next to a grandfather clock. Er i in the foreground, there is er uh a w a waiter er presenting a bottle of wine er to a couple eating dinner, a man and a woman. Erm the gentleman appears to be sampling er the wine. Erm er people in the background er on the right-hand side, a gentleman is serving er what I presume would be the entrees. Er on left-hand side, er the couple appears to be eating. Erm and the entrance, abacus oh rope across it. Er and <.> that's about it. O K. Yeah. Have you managed to find a er favorite restaurant that you like so far? Er here? Er <.> not really. I I never seem to eat at the same place twice. Hmm. Erm. So tell me about the last place you went to. Yes. Er the last place I went to was er the sushi restaurant with the the belt. Ah yes. Restaurant erm whi which is uh uh uh uh very interesting concept to say the least. Erm to to know exactly how much you are paying er based on the color plate that you pull off er i i is is very interesting. Erm I ate with one of my friends and her parents. Er and they were pulling off er the shiny plates which, of course, are the more expensive ones. laughter Er because the nicer the plate looks, er the more money uh er you are paying. Er and they were they were pulling off, for the most part, just shiny plates for for me to eat. Erm and and they were eating all the all the lower and cheaper plates. Er er the sushi wasn't good from from what I was told. Er I I can't really tell the difference. Erm because I never had sushi before I came here. Er and it tasted fine to me. But but they apologized for how bad the sushi was and told me they they would never go back to that restaurant again. Erm and, yeah, that was my that was my last experience of restaurant. Right, right. What have you done for entertainment? Er entertainment. Yesterday, I went down to Ikebukuro. O K. Er to the Sunshine City. Hm. Hm. Er saw the aquarium er which is on the roof of er of the building, er which is very different to watch seals bounce balls on their nose er er you know, at er mm two hundred feet in the air. Erm er and went to Starbucks to have a cup of coffee. And then went and saw a movie, er ""Triple X"" er with Vin Diesel. Ah. Er I had almost had to fill a personal loan application to to be able to afford er the movie. Er. That was the first time. Er it's second time I've seen the movie. Er i it's incredibly expensive er especially for a movie that that, you know, I I could've seen it over the summer. Erm <.> er yeah, i i it's i i it it's funny you're paying more money to see something later than than Americans. Right, right. Yeah. Erm er that's pretty much what I do. Er you go to the bar or the club, Sure. erm and get liquored up before before you go, er so you can save a few bucks, erm stop at the convenience store which is nice. Because in XXX12, er the convenience stores can't sell alcohol. Oh. Yeah. O K. Yeah. O K. Great. I'm gonna change it a little bit. I want you to try a a role-play. O K. I want you to imagine this scenario here, XXX02, if you don't mind. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. I'm gonna be the travel agent. O K. Er we'll do this in the shop, face to face. O K. O K. Um yes. Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you? Ah yeah. I I booked a trip through travel agency er to Shanghai. Er and it was supposed to be a, you know, very luxurious. Er but it turned out to be anything but uh er luxurious. Erm the hotel room which I was promised to be five star er w w was no better than than a Holiday Inn. Erm and the food that was that was served wa was was barely barely edible when er what was described in the travel brochure wa was supposed to be er food beyond my wildest imagination. Well you have to understand, sir, er a a a five-star hotel in America is different from a five-star hotel in China. Er n nonetheless erm I I I d I do understand that. But what was what was described er in the travel brochure versus the actual product that was er given to me er were were were two completely opposites. I w I was promised one thing and given another. A an and I I I would like to get some form of, Well in what way in in what way I mean a compensation. was it so opposite, sir? Er the bathroom is dirty. Er the sheets appeared to mm not be thoroughly washed. Er er the the service er over all er was was very poor. Well you have to allow the local customs. Er. Er local customs. N nonetheless, i i it was still it was still poor and it was still er yeah, uh uh still different from <.> fro from what was described in the in the travel brochure. Oh. And if there would be some way that we could possibly redress the situation, er so that I mean I I will feel much more comfortable doing business with this travel agency in the future. Well erm as you know, sir, we c we can't directly be responsible for the local staff. Ah. If you would like to complain to the hotel directly. Uh regardless er mm whether you're responsible for the local staff or not, you're responsible for my satisfaction as a customer. And yo your mm mm yeah, since I would like to do er some additional traveling in the future, I would like to conduct my business with you. Er er I would appreciate if this situation could be redressed in in some fashion. O K, sir. Er I will erm I will talk to the hotel. I will investigate and I will get back to you. O K. Would that be O K for the time being? Er that would be O K for the time being. Er I I'll mm you know, you have my name and number on file. Give me a call back. O K, I will, sir. Yeah. O K.

Er sleeping in er uh hotels that that that I wouldn't ever wanna sleep in again. laughter Erm a and and eating food that I was questioning er uh the very fact that I was very hungry er while I was while I was eating it and whether I truly needed the nourishment at that time, o or or even wondering what kind of nourishment I was getting out of the food I was eating. Erm on the other hand, it was rather cheap. Er. I can imagine. Yeah. Yeah. Er e everything i i it's er Mexico is a seventy-five-percent-off sale. Er everything is just seventy-five percent cheaper. great, though. It's nobody around Yeah, no one around. . Erm i i i i it was just beautiful. Erm was just absolutely gorgeous.

You can decide what to purchase. Hai. Erm O K. Yes. Good afternoon, sir. How may I help you? Hi. Er I er <..> what did I buy? laughter Anything is O K. Erm ah yeah. I I recently bought er this backpack. Er. And I was wondering. A very fine backpack. Er it it is. It is a wonderful backpack indeed. Er unfortunately, er I I w I would like to exchange it er for, you know, a a a different backpack if that would be possible. Erm. You said it was a very fine backpack. Oh it is a very fine backpack indeed. Erm unfortunately, er mm snap er i i i it doesn't match er most of er the clothes I I would like to wear it with. I want something that's more suitable or more I see. more suitable for me to wear. I see. Uh you knew that it didn't match when you bought it. Er I I didn't have er my outerwear with me er when I when I purchased the the backpack. And you you have forgotten Erm. what color design. laughter Yeah. Er I I I d I don't nec er I I made a a bad decision when I purchased the bag. I'm I'm not gonna deny that. Er but I w I would like to mm just excha I I've I haven't used it. Erm and I would just like to exchange it for a very similar product, er just a different color. As you know, we have a bargain on at the moment. And during the bargain sale, we have a policy against exchanges. Erm I I I I understand that you have a a policy against exchanges. But, you know, if you could possibly make an exception in in this one case, er I would I would greatly appreciate. I ha I have been a very good patron er at this establishment for for many years. Erm and and if you could make an exception for this, er I would like to continue conducting my business at this establishment. It is er unused? Uh yeah, it's completely unused. Erm well sir, if if we can get something exactly the same price, Er tha that's all I'm looking for. then I think that we could probably manage to do that. Excellent. Thank you very much. O K, thank you very much. Seems like some experience you've already had before. laughter Er how what have you bought in Japan so far? Er what have I bought? I mean. expensive. The only thing, you know, about my big purchase so far has been a, you know, the God Savor. Ah. Er the electronic translator designed for, you know, Ah. someone who doesn't speak fluent Japanese. I see. Er yeah. Because everything doesn't pop up in in kanji I haven't seen that. Yeah. How did you Yeah. find that thing? Er I I just went down to Akihabara er and just looked around for for hours. Erm talked to people in in broken English and my <.> very, very broken Japanese. Er. How how have you been using it? Er. I I ge. What sort of situations? Uh uh I use it I use it when I go to the store Hm. erm and I need something. Hm. And I have no idea what what the word is for. Erm. Er it it also i i i it's amazing fact that er a lot of the words it gives i i it gives as, like sample sentences, er how wou you would use the word. Erm <.> erm i it also like when words are are distinctively feminine words or distinctively male words, er I don't know that. Er which which is another great feature. Er if you type in like, ""Watashi,"" you know, it says that this is mainly used by by women. Yeah, men don't say ""Watashi."" So yeah, that that that's very handy feature. Wow. Yeah. That must've cost an awful lot. Er this was eighteen thousand yen. Oh that's not bad. Yeah. Erm so there is when I bought it, a hundred forty dollars. Er which is s not mm er on the Amazon, it was one ninety-five, Yeah. er plus shipping and handling. So it is it's much cheaper than than Amazon which is which is quite surprising. Well it's a good deal. Er yeah. Because Amazon usually has great deals. Erm er a and I just think I got a better deal. O K. So. O K. One more role-play I'd like you to to look at. Erm it's at a party. We're doing this on the telephone. The interviewee is reading the card. O K? All right. O K, XXX02. We're doing it on the telephone. Yeah. Er ring-ring. Hello? This is er XXX01 here. Er hi, XXX01. This is er XXX02. How are you? XXX02. Yes. I I I know, XXX01. Er really sorry I I I couldn't show up at at your dinner party this past weekend. Er un unfortunately, I I just had some things come up a a at the last minute. They were so important. Erm. Uh XXX01, erm eh <.> a a as much as I wanted to go to your to your dinner party, erm my brother-in-law called me er before I walked out the door er to let me know that that er his grandfather had died. Erm he was very close to his grandfather. And since my sister er is married to him, I I I went over there to to talk to them. Erm and they were just very upset and they need someone to talk to. Er. Well yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. Erm I just wondered though, I mean your sister's just close by. I that's we're on the way I know we're on the way. You could have popped in. Yyy you know, y y you're right. Erm but <.> sometimes, er circumstances happen. And you just go with your got feeling on how to react to such situations a a and you just react to them that way. Erm and, you know, looking back at it, you know, I could have stopped at your at your party which er I I probably should have should have done. Erm but nonetheless, I I I made I made a decision that at the time, I felt very comfortable with. Erm I I I feel that family obligations are are are the utmost importance. Erm and um so, you know, nonetheless, I I I would appreciate, you know, if you could include me er in your future future plans. Sure. I mean that isn't a problem. I do understand the situation. But I just wonder did you didn't even call? Yeah. Yyy you know, i it that that was that was wrong of me to do. Erm I I I I should have called. You are right. Er I mean uh uh er I mean you've been a very good friend to me, XXX01. laughter Erm and it's and for me, not to call is i is uh iii it's it's kind of a a bad thing to do it's a to such good friend. But, you know, I mean I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll try to do better in the future, you know. I I. Well don't worry about it. We're gonna have another party soon. So, Yeah. <.> please come. Please. Thank you very much. O K. Thank you very much. . O K, thank you very much, XXX02. It's the end of the last role-play. Erm have you been to a party <.> in Japan? Er here, no. No? Erm I've got one to go to in in December. Oh. Yeah. Gonna go over What's the. er my friend's house. Er her er her parents want me to to come up there. Erm so I'll eat their er incredibly expensive sushi erm and not pay for it. Better than the conveyer belt sushi. Uh much much better than the conveyer belt. Erm. You know there would be. Oh what's the occasion of going to? Er I'm not sure what the occasion is. I I was just invited up. Erm <.> so I'm looking forward to that. Er that'll be good. I mean they're they're they're such nice people. Er very very kind to me. Er er eh eh eh I I I've done nothing to to to deserve the kindness. People are kind here. Erm but but er but they've just been exceptionally kind to me, whi which whi whi which if I if I could explain that to them i in in Japanese, you know, how much I appreciate their kindness, Hmm. erm er I'll I'll I'll count my one year here as as a success. People are kind. People . Yeah. Erm what will you do during the New Year holiday? Er my brother is coming over here. Hm. Er so I'll I'll go see the Imperial Palace er one of the two days that they open it up. Er maybe go to Kyoto. Er er but er I'm not really not really sure. Erm and then after that, just er head to Hong Kong or South Korea, one of the two. Right. sounds good. O K. I'd like to show you a a picture sequence now. Erm a station scenario. But I'd er I'd like you to make up a story from these pictures, XXX02. Oh yeah? Going from one to six. Hm. One, two, three, four, five, six. But this story happened before. So please start, ""One day last week"", and then go. Yeah. Er one day last week, I woke up, er I had breakfast, er talked to my parents, er then walked to the train station. Erm I got to train station. Er I was I was waiting in the line er with everyone else. Erm and er all of a sudden, my my phone rang. So I pick up the phone er to answer it, er a and hopefully get off before the train came er when I dropped my suitcase. Erm er I I looked down, that's sitting right in the middle of the tracks. Er person next to me er just kind of looks over and and, you know, shakes his head, puts his hands up like he you know, as as if he doesn't know what to do. Erm and I have no idea what to do either. Er the train pulls into the station a a a couple minutes later. Er a a and I'm waiting for my my my briefcase to be crashed by the train erm or or or even even worse, you know, something else bad to happen. Erm er fortunately, the the the the train came, left, er and there was my suitcase still sitting between the tracks. Er I'm touched. Er and one of one of the very kind conductors er went down onto the tracks, er handed me my suitcase before the next train came. O K. Thank you very much, XXX02. Now, er you haven't had too much exposure. But what's the er most dramatic or curious thing you've seen on the train so far? Er I I I think it's just being packed in like sardines erm i is is an amazing thing. Erm and sitting there er <.> I think falling asleep is is is the most interesting thing. Erm I I <.> every thi this morning, I w I was on Sobu sen. Er and standing up, I I was half asleep er just like the person next to me erm because I was tired. A an and they were tired, too. And so you just kind of doze off in into a into a half asleep er while you are standing and being shaken around by the train. Still not waking up. Eh eh yeah. You you wake up when the train stops. You look up, check what station you are at, and then fall back asleep standing. <..> Pretty good. Yeah. O K. Er one more er sequence of pictures I'd like to show you, XXX02. Er going from one to six again erm like this. Please make up a story. And again, this happened before. So please start, ""One day last week"". . Erm. Er one day last week, er driving down the road, er and all the sudden, er before in front of me is a gentleman on a scooter er talking on his cell phone er er probably to s some female, er very distracting. Er I I come around a corner and uh er eh either I hit the scooter or or he hit, you know, my car. I'm I'm not exactly sure what happened. Er but ph cell phone fell on the ground. There is there is a bunch of damage to the to the er his scooter. Er called the police. The police came. We filled out a a an accident report. Erm not exactly sure how how the accident report will work out, whose favor. Erm but er a truck came and and it took away the the scooter er to the shop. Er and I went on my way. O K. Thank you very much, XXX02. Er do you have a car back home, XXX02? I did. Did? I did, yeah. It it no longer What happened to it? no longer functions. Erm i in the state of XXX12, they they insist on having your car inspected every year. <.> And this past year, for my car to pass the inspection would have cost anywhere between two thousand and three thousand dollars. I purchased the vehicle er five years ago no, f er four years ago for two thousand dollars. Er and since then, I I I put on about seventy thousand miles, eighty thousand miles. Er so paying a little bit more than what I paid for the vehicle to begin with just to get it to pass inspection for for one year, er I I I found it a little bit extreme, er uh especially when I can buy a better car for for a little less miles on it. Er not to mention the fact that I didn't have two thousand dollars er to pay for the car. Er it happened in I I guess that happened last October. Er so I was at school at the time. Erm I stayed at school all year er over the summer, and then I came here. And I w I can't use the car while I'm here. So hopefully when I go back, er money will magically appear erm and I will get a car. Or erm be at school the entire next year and it won't matter anyway. laughter Er so ei ei ei either way, er they will work out. What happened to the old car? Er it mm now belongs to erm Volunteers of America, I think. Er i i i it actually was a a good tax right off, er for my parents. How did you how how was that done? How was that arranged? Er in America, you you can donate your car er to charity. And then right off the full retail value of the car er as a tax deduction. Ah. Yeah. It's something they're they're pushing really big now. Erm i i it's a great way to er rather than trying to sell your car. Erm to i i i it really helps, depending on what tax pack you are in. Er if you're in a higher tax packet, you you you can save pretty much, e exactly how much money you you you would have gotten of if you would have s er sold the car, or even more sometimes. I donated, yeah. Certainly more than having to pay for that inspection. Yeah. Yeah. So it was a very logical decision. Yeah. Oh yeah. What was your best memory with that car you put eighty thousand miles on? laughter Wow. Best memory that I can record on tape? No. Don't. No. Erm. laughter Ah O K, not the best memory. Er where did you go in that car er a m a most memorable to think? <..> Is it tape out of it? laughter Er. Yeah. Tell me something t tell me some you went with the car laughter Erm. out of that eighty thousand miles. Er yeah. Gee, I just drove it all over the place around my to work mostly. Erm <.> I mean hundreds of trips back and forth to work. Er eh just driving, because for some reason, er er er I put on a lot of miles dating dating a girl who lived about twenty miles from my house, er that was about forty miles Yeah. ev every other day. That would put on a lot of miles. Erm for for looking back on it, no good reason. Erm. At the time. But at the time, it was it was an exceptionally good reason to drive forty miles er in one day. O K. Erm may I ask, what kind of car would you like to have when you get back? I mean, so you just I love to I'd I'd like the James Bond's car. I mean I would like the the B M W Z three Roadster. Erm but being that er financially, I I'm not in any condition to afford that er regardless of what I've told B M W dealerships when I've test driven on. Erm er just just a cheap car that that goes <.> that starts. Right. And and and can go places. O K. Er er I I don't I don't need I I need something that can make a three-hour drive between my college and my home and that's it. Right. Right. I can perceive that. O K. Well we're almost at the end of the interview now, XXX02. Erm you're gonna get something to eat and then like then what? What are your plans for the rest of day? Er mm for the rest of my day, my plan's get this stuff, going home and punish myself by studying er Japanese for for a few hours, erm whi which which is frustrating er when when you don't understand things, er you're trying to study that. Erm snap and then I'll pro probably er mm do some research for a paper, er watch the evening news, er drink a beer, and go to bed. O K. And I'm. Any plans to go out this week? Er this week, erm no plans so far. Er everything always just falls in place. Erm. What's the schedule like here? Busy. Mhm. Two or three classes a day or something? Er Mondays, I just have Japanese, er Tuesdays, I have Japanese and my Social Organization class. O K. Er we talked about our field placements and the like. Er Wednesdays, I have my field placement. Er Thursdays is Japanese and my er er Contemporary Politics of Japan. Er Fridays Japanese and the er Contemporary Economy of Japan. Erm the all the classes outside of Japanese are are three hours. Wow. Er and my Japanese class is an hour and forty-five minutes. Hm. Hm. Er so it's i i it's quite a bid of time. Yeah. Hm. Erm. Yeah. Hm yeah. Yeah. That is a schedule. Yeah. That is a schedule. Yeah. O K. Well it's a very fine day. I hope you enjoy the rest of the day. Ah thank you. Hope you find something good to eat. Thank you very much. Er thank you very much for your time, XXX02. My pleasure. O K. Thank you very much.",0
"N_file00004.txt 2002-11-07 male 20 USA 1_12m computer science ski electric shop train_intermediate invitation_intermediate landlord_intermediate stray cat restaurant O K. Let's begin. Hello. My name is XXX01. May I have your name, please? Yeah. I'm XXX02. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, XXX02. Where're you from? I'm from XXX03, XXX04, but uh suburb of right near XXX03. But Uh-huh. it's usually just easier to say XXX03. laughter I see. Yeah. So what do you do in Japan? Well ur right now, I'm studying Japanese at the XXX05. Uh-huh. And ur mainly I try to just I don't have a job right now like most students do, so I have more free time. So I try to have fun, and just study Japanese. Right. I see. Can you tell me more about that school in XXX06? Yes. Ur at XXX06, they have well we're not actually really part of the school. What we have is we have the foreign language program, and we mainly have classes on our own. So we're in classrooms in this school, but mostly you're in with the other students who are the ur foreign exchange students. And they're not really with the kind of students much because we don't have enough Japanese taker Japanese-taught course. Hm. But we interact with them enough, and we meet them in the cafeteria and everything. I ur have my classes taught in Japanese are just kanji and Japanese. But then history and society and everything are taught in English. And mm most are just Americans in those classes. Mhm. I see. O K. So you said you have a lot of free time. Hm. What do you do? Well ur well I I live in the dormitories. So lots of the people live at home, ur they uh do things with their families. And they go home, and they just do stuff with their families, and eat with them. And sometimes on the weekends, I go out and do things with them. So they actually have a lot less. When I ask them to do things, they're like, ""Oh you know, I'm doing this stuff with my family."". Hmm. So especially because I'm in the dorm, and I just live in a single by myself, it's pretty much at school, or I'm on my own. So I try to come up with things to do, but ur when there's really nothing to do, I play uh Gameboy in my room by myself uh because I have no T V or computer. But I like to go out a lot, on the weekends especially. This weekend, we're gonna go do karaoke. I've been doing that a lot recently. Usually with Japanese and Americans. Now, last weekend, we went to Shibuya, and just went to clubs, and and had fun. Well I'm going to a movie tonight. I usually don't do that though in Japan, because it's too expensive. laughter But a movie just came out, ur ""The Ring,"" and then I like horror movies a lot, and it looks pretty cool. So Uh-huh. I'm gonna be there tonight. Mhm. So why do you like horror movies so much? Well mo mo mo mainly because they're funny a funny thing. I I watch most of the horror movies I watch aren't scary. They're just kind of stupid. And I don't really mind seeing lots of violence. And normally they're just badly made, and they're fun to watch with my friends. But then I also like the ones that are scary. And if they are scary, it's even better because ur I think having watched so many, they don't scare me at all anymore. So then I especially try to watch more and more hopefully hoping that one will scare me. And everyone keeps saying that this one is horribly frightening. So I hope it might get some sort of reaction out of me, laughter instead of just like, ""Oh that's interesting"" kind of reactions. But mm I ur but mo mostly I watch them because they're bad and stupid. laughter And it's fun to laugh at them. O K. Mm. All right. So urm you said you live in a dorm. Yes. Urm why a dorm and not a home stay ? Well oh yeah. I thought about that. It was a big decision. Ur the two biggest choices I had to make was what city to come within, and I I chose easy one. I figured it it ur the program was called XXX07. Mh-hmm. And like, ""Oh XXX08."". You know, I might as well go to the city that everyone knows. And if I talk about it, people would know about it. And it's a biggest one. Then we actually wound up living in XXX09. laughter But it di it really didn't matter since we live so close to XXX08. The other one was home stay or dorm. Most everyone picked home stay. My main reason was I don't like living with my family in America. And I love them, and I've known them er for a long time, but I can't stand living at home. It just not enough freedom. And I find having to do things annoying and having to be home for dinner at certain times, I find it very restrictive to just having fun with your friends. And I sort of assumed other people would feel the same way. But when I got here, it turned out everyone else is living in the homes. And only a couple of kids, there is four of us in the dorm. One of them ended up being one of my best friends. Mh-hmm. And since we both have so much free time, we usually do everything together. Mh-hmm. Like me and him are the only one who's going to the movie tonight. Hm. Lots of people just have things to do. And at first, I felt really bad like when everyone was meeting their home stay families. I was worried I felt numb because they were all meeting them, and uh er we were just sitting there. And they're like, ""Oh they're gonna have such a good time."". And the first couple of weeks, the families took them places, and did things with them. And we seem we seem like we're left out. But now, when people wanna have fun, they come to us. And they complain about their families, and say, ""Oh you know, it's great. We like them, but it's really annoying how we have to be home. And like they want me to go to this place this weekend, but I'd rather come with you guys."". So now, we kind of feel better about it because we actually have a lot more freedom in a way. Er people come to us and say, ""We wanna do something fun. What should we do?"". Because we have we had to figure it out on our own. And our Japanese might be better at home. But we understand Japan better because we had to figure it out on our own, I think. And when we have to go get a new train pass, we just kind of have to go do it. Most people have their families fill out the stuff for them. So it's kind of getting take back and forth. But eh my main reason, urm speaking honestly, was a girls issue because I I I couldn't live in a house with a family if I expected to have girlfriends or girlfriend. Right. laughter laughter Yes. Important? Yes. Er a girlfriend. And it's true I none of the home people do, and I do so because they just can't like it's their lifestyles aren't very permitting of it. Mhm. Good choice. Mm. O K. Thanks. O K. I'm going to show you a picture now. Would you describe what you see here? O K. This is a ski resort. Mh-hmm. And ur everyone's playing in the snow. They're skiers and kids playing the snowballs. There's a kid being hit in the face with a snowball. And one guy's falling down on the skies, and he's just a little bit buried in the snow. And mm it looks like they're all having a good time. Also, mm there's yeah, mm mm just today, we were talking about, ur one of my friends from XXX03 like snow, and I don't. We're both from XXX03. Mh-hmm. And I don't. It's too cold and annoying. laughter It's hard to drive in. So I'm looking forward to no snow in this winter in Japan. Mm. O K. All right. So you're from XXX03, and it's cold there. Yeah. How do you usually spend your time when you're back home Oh. during the winter? Watching a lot of movies mostly. Ur just uh just today, my my friend XXX10 who's from XXX11, she came in to class wearing five or six layers of coat, shirt, sweatshirt, and just saying how how cold it was. And I was wearing an under shirt and that's all. And I'm like it's really not bad today at all. Uh-huh. And I had um I I thought that I'd put a head arm, but I took it off because I was too warm. And she thought I was crazy. So it is very it is generally cold in the winter, and we've watched a lot of movies, play a lot of video games, mostly stuff you can do inside. Go to a movie theater or rent movies. It's much cheaper in America so you can rent a lot of movies, or go see movies four times a week, and it's really not that bad. Mhm. Mm. I see. O K. So ur do you yourself ski? No, I actually I've never been skiing because while we get a lot of snow, it's very flat. Hmm. So unless ur the only people who are doing skiing is with their family took them on ski trips to other areas of America. And my family, just eh since they had never skied, they don't take us. So really it's if your family skies, then they would have taken you. I know some people who had gone, but it's really nothing nearby. You have to go quite a ways, often in airplane to go fly out west to go skiing. I haven't done it. I have been cross-country skiing and that's where you ski in flat ground. But it's not really fun. It's more of a workout because you just have to move your legs yourself the whole time. And it's one of the most difficult exercises, I think. Mm. O K. Actually, if you can remember, can you tell me about the last time you went cross country skiing? Yes. I I it was a long time ago actually. It was in eighth grade when I was in junior high. There was a one week trip where we went to ur the state above us, ur to XXX12, ur no, XXX13 because they have even more snow than us, and it's colder. And we only a small portion of our eighth grade could go, and everybody signed up. And I remember I was a last person whose name was picked. So I was very close to not going. And it ended up being really fun because it was not uh there is summer camp, but I had never gone so it's one of the first times I was away from my parents for a very long period for a week, just with my friends. And ur me and my junior high friends are good friends. And we went there, and we went cross country skiing, and walked on snow shoes which are like tennis rackets you walk on. laughter Ur and I remember ur the food there was really bad. laughter Mh-hmm. But it was funny because we laughed about it. And. Mm. Ur yeah. O K. Thanks. Sure. Another picture. O K. Describe this what's in. O K. This is an electronic store. And it's three o'clock Mh-hmm. in the afternoon. And there's laughter many different sizes of stereo systems offered. And the customer is asking a question of the ur clerk. And the clerk is pointing at the watches, I believe. So maybe it's a question about watches. There's an extremely large T V and a smaller T V. And there's large C D players, small C D player and telephones for sale. Also cameras. <.> More? Hm? O K. O K? Fine. So have you done any shopping in XXX08? Yes. But ur living at all cost so much that I don't buy anything. Hm. I know that I uh all summer, I worked full hour um full time I worked forty-five hours a week every week all summer just to save money to come here. But I knew that if I came here and bought things, then I would run out of the money very quickly. So now, I do spend a lot of money, and I don't ever hold back. If we go out, I would spend as much money as possible. And sometimes ur even a hundred dollars a weekend. But I don't buy things because that would really send me back. But I'd like to go shopping and look ur especially at electronic stores because I'm a I'm a computer science major Mh-hmm. in America. And I really like, ur I mentioned before video games and movies and ur computers. So I like to go to Akihabara, Mh-hmm. and just walk around and look at things. But Sure. I never buy anything. I have ur laughter because even even though if a electronic's made in Japan, sometimes it it it isn't cheaper in Japan. Mh-hmm. Just people say, ""Oh you can buy really cheap electronics in Japan."". But actually no. Hmm. It's not any cheaper. It might be better, Mh-hmm. but it's not cheaper. I see. So um and then lots of times uh my uh girlfriends wanted to go shopping. And I just um go with, Uh-huh. and but I don't buy anything. Right. Mm. O K. Now, we're going to do some role-plays. O K. And I'll give you a card, and if you can read it. So we just talk . Sure. O K? The interviewee is reading the card. Ready? O K. O K. May I help you, sir? Ur listen. I need to get to New York. Uh-huh. And I need to get there really fast. Uh-huh. So can you tell me when the next train is coming? If I can buy a ticket now, ur if it would be cheaper for make a reservation on the phone, ur well how many tickets are available, what classes, and if possible, the train that comes after that? O K. First of all, you asked me how often trains are available. But there're many types. O K. So I need to know Mm. your. Well I suppose ur the cheapest train, actually, would do fine for me. O K. Well there are two cheap trains. Mm. O K. Ur what is difference between the trains? Urm just whether there is a food um court or not inside. Mhm. O K. Well I didn't bring any food with me so the food train sounds pretty good. Mh-hmm. Ur when is that train leaving? It's leaving in fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes. That's excellent. Can I buy my ticket right now? Sure. If I use can I use my credit card? Yes. O K. VISA is O K? Sure. O K. Thank you. Ur give me one of those. O K. Here you go. Have a nice trip. O K. Thank you. O K. Thanks. All right. So have you traveled much in Japan? In Japan, not really. Ur again, it's kind of a money issue. laughter People keep asking, ""Oh do you are you planning are you going to Kyoto or Osaka?"". I say, ""No."". laughter I can go play because I figure there's enough places I can get to um nearby, and see things that I don't really it really would cost a lot to spend a weekend trip. Staying over night especially. Ur again, I I don't mind spending money, but paying for hotel and shinkansen and everything would really eat up, so I haven't gone anywhere far. But I try eh to go everywhere around XXX08 area. And but at this point, I've actually been everywhere I wanted to go. So maybe traveling somewhere else might be a good idea. Mh-hmm. But I've been repeating areas I've liked Hm. in the past, though. Mm-hm. Such as? Mm. Well Shibuya. Ur I went to a couple of er nightspots. And I thought that was most fun. And. Er. O K. We're . Oh sure. Erm so you mentioned your you need to save money. Mm. Urm so other than not buying things, how do you save money? Huh. Well ur one of my first things, in the first couple of weeks, Uh-huh. I used the vending machines a lot. It i this is just something little. But everyday I would generally buy a drink from the vending machine. And I just said if I just carry water in my back pack, and don't buy a drink everyday for a hundred twenty yen, Hm. I after three months, that would probably save me some money. And so I try and to do the things aren't really necessary, I try not to do. And also in the beginning, I bought a lot of ice cream. Just I'd see ice cream, and I just buy it. Hm. So now I ur so I try to do that. Also, if possible, on the trains the cheapest ride possible. Hm. Again, I don't wanna be cheap, but I will run out of money if I don't. But then I also ur I could have gotten some part-time English teaching job. I know some students every weekend or once a week go somewhere. Mh-hmm. And they make money helping with English. I think I should have done that, but I was too lazy. And also it would ur cut into my free time which I value so much. But then I want something comes up where I can make some money doing something at once, ur then Uh-huh. I'd like to. laughter So. Great. O K. Yeah. Our next role-play is this one. O K? O K. The interviewee is reading the card. Mm. O K. Ready? So it's a phone conversation. O K. So ring-ring. Hello, This is XXX01. Hi. Ur this is XXX02. We're thinking about going to see ""The Ring"" tonight. Uh-huh. Ur have you heard of it? No. O K. It's just a new movie. It came out in America while ago. Uh-huh. It's supposed to be pretty scary. Ur I I honestly don't know what's it about, but it's supposed to be pretty cool. It's only rated P G thirteen Uh-huh. so it might not be gory. But it might still be scary from what I hear. Uh-huh. Ur now me and Zack are going. No one else wanted to come. And ur we were wondering though we don't have a car. Can you drive? I can drive, but I'm working today. Ur you're working today. Yeah. Mm. Urm O K. If you really wanna see the movie, we could go tomorrow. But if you don't care, we're just gonna go tonight without you. What do you think? Urm no, I'd really like to go. You would? Yeah. Ur could you drive us tomorrow? Urr O K. O K. Ur that's good. Ur O K. The movie show times tomorrow are at on the hour, they start at nine, ten, eleven at night. I think later in the night is better. Uh-huh. What time do you think would be best for you? Yeah, later is better. . Later is better? O K. Well ur we'll shoot for ten o'clock because the eleven o'clock, we might get too tired. O K. So could you maybe pick us up at nine-thirty? Sure. And then we'll go straight to the theater. Sounds good. Sounds good. O K. So see you tomorrow. O K. Thanks for calling. Thanks. Bye. O K. That's the end of this one. All right. So urm you're gonna go watch ""The Ring"" for real? laughter Yes, yes. Uh-huh. Urm actually, the original movie was made in Japan. I just heard that. Uh-huh. Ur and I also heard it wasn't made that long ago, either. Nineteen ninety-eight? Or so. Did you see it? No. laughter No, O K. Uh-huh. I'm very curious. Have you seen any Japanese movies recently? Well unfor um unfortunately, er we don't get many foreign movies at all in XXX12. And if we do get a Japanese movie, it's gonna be anime. Uh-huh. And there aren't that many Japanese movies in the first place ur compared to America. Right. But ur the only one that I know was released in America as an actual movie was ""Shall We Dance?"" Uh-huh. I know that one is popular internationally. I thought that was cute, more of a girl movie, but it was pretty funny. Ur. O K. Yeah. So from your impression from that movie, ur could you make a comparison between like American movies and Japanese movies? Well urm that was only one I saw. I could do better to comparing American animation to Japanese animation O K. since I've seen yeah, I've seen plenty of a anime because that does come over. O K. Ur in general, I think the main difference is America only makes ur animation for children, and it can't ur it can't ever convince yourself that a movie might be for older people. And I know that Japan ur has they well use animation to make any sort of movie than Americans might make. I could just be something that just a drama or absolutely no fighting and just people talking. And it would be animated. America doesn't really ever do anything like that. It would only be comedy or for children in general. And it's kind of looked-down upon. Ur you can say, ""Oh I like kids movies, and I like to watch them sometimes."". But actually, really liking cartoons in America is sort of considered childish. I know that at least, even on the trains I see, grown men all the time reading comics which I think is nice because they are made for older men and children, there's different kinds. So I'd say that's the main difference is that mm they ur use it er the medium to for any sort of area, Hm. not just one. Mm-hm. I see. O K. Now the last role-play is this one. O K? The interviewee is reading the card. Mm. O K. I er was thinking about moving into an apartment. I wanna get out of my parents' house. Mh-hmm. I just graduated, and they drive me crazy. So I would like to stay in the XXX03 area, though. And ur so something somewhere nearby is good. And ur I was wondering what you ur have available that is in the medium price range. And if also ur ur how ma uh how many people the apartment is for, if there's one or two or something like that. Mm-hm. Mm. Well we have two or three urm medium-priced places right in the city. Mm. O K. In the city O K, the city ur now, that would be with with traffic and all, I don't know what ur I would I prefer to live a little bit outside ur as well. Do you have anything maybe two ur half hour or so from the main area? Yeah. Urm sure. We have more actually O K. in the suburbs. Yeah. And it's probably a little cheaper. Mm-hm. That's good. Mm. Now ur also, something in the nice neighborhood would be good. Ur one of the yeah lower crime rate neighborhoods. Mm-hm. Because I get worried about some neighborhoods sometimes. Right, right. Mm. Well that kind of depends on your budget. That's true. I just started working so it seems to me like I have a lot of money, but I'm not sure yet. I'm also making payments for my new car. So I have to think about that. Maybe if you get me a list of prices, I can consider and look over it and call you back tomorrow. Sure. But ur it's a busy season now. Hmm. So you might wanna look around today. Ohh that's true. That's true. Is there anything nearby you could you would can I can I look at the apartments first? Can we go to them? Of course? Of course, sure. O K. And ur are there people living in them now, or they're currently empty waiting for the first person? People are in there now. Ohh O K. Yeah. And they're wai oh yeah, they're waiting for somebody to talk to. Right. O K. Yeah. Then maybe we should go around and take a look at a few closer ones. O K. So um I'll ring some people up, and we can go in like ten minutes. O K. Thank you very much. O K. Thanks. All right. Yeah. Er so when you go back, do you plan to live alone? Well ur the thing is well the most interesting thing is I've always lived with my brother. Uh-huh. We shared a room. I've never had my own room. I've always shared the room with my brother. Then I got to college, and I had a roommate at college. And but now, my sister is getting married. Mh-hmm. So she's moving out of the house within a month. So when I go home, I'll actually have my own room. Hmm. So living at home well actually seem better for me because it'll be seen a lot different because I have my own room now. I think a big reason I don't like living at home is because I have to share my room. So I never really s it never seems like I really like being there. If I have my own room where I can spend time, I think it'll be better because I can invite friends over. We can hang out in my room because often if they come over, then my brother would come in. And it would be no fun. It would be kind of awkward. So ur I think I will definitely stay at home for a while. And it's just winter break ur for couple of weeks uhtil I go back to school. But um hopefully I've been living alone now in Japan so I've just started. So I'm kind of used to it now. So hopefully when I go back to school, maybe I can find a single. Mh-hmm. Also all of my friends at school already have roommates. Because I left America, er they all found they fou he my roommate found a new roommate. So if I go, I don't know, I don't want to room with a stranger. laughter Yeah. I see. O K. Urm you mentioned your sister. Can you tell me more about her? Yes. Ur my sister, she's twenty-two. It's very young to get married. I'm twenty. I have no intention of getting married at twenty-two. She we went to the same university. Mh-hmm. But I was I never really much liked her. She was always very mean to me and the family. And I don't think she's very nice. So we never hung out. Lots of times, I would know people at my school Uh-huh. for months. And ur then I mentioned my sister like goes to the school, and they would be shocked. ""You have a sister here? Why don't you ever talk about her?"" I'm like, ""I don't like her."". So she's getting married, and that's good because all she does is fight with people at home. If I go home, we can't even have dinner. She usually starts an argument. So ur her wedding is actually next month. I have to go back to America for her wedding. It's mm very inconvenient. But I think it's a very happy occasion for everyone because my mom's happy she's getting married. I'm happy she's leaving. Urm yeah I get her room. Hmm. So I have to fly back to America for a couple of days. But also, it's right after Thanksgiving. Ur and I'm glad I can go home for that American holiday. So I'll actually get home on Thanksgiving, and eat with the family then. After that, have the wedding. Uh-huh. And then come back to Japan. And ur then when I go home for Christmas, she'll be gone, and I get her room. So that's good. She I think it's it's good that she's getting married though, because ur she doesn't really do much, and she doesn't have many friends so it's probably better for her to be married. But I would feel it would um since I'm I it'll take away for my ur young, carefree life style. laughter Hmm. So I think it's a good idea for everyone that she's getting married. But definitely a little young. laughter Yeah. O K. All right. Urm <.> yeah, so you're going back home next month. Yes. Urm how do you plan to arrange your trip, like how are you gonna find your ticket back? Well ur I was very lucky because I knew XXX14 who was just in here. Ah. Ur XXX14 and I went to the same university in America. And we did not know each other. But we were both coming on this program. So we met and said, ""Oh I'm XXX02. We're going to Japan together."". And she said, ""Oh O K."". And she said her aunt is a travel agent, and she said her aunt can buy us tickets for us. And I thought that was really convenient because it's not very easy in ur to find cheap tickets. So her aunt bought us tickets, a round trip to come here and to go home in December. Mh-hmm. Then for my trip home and er for my sister's wedding, I told my father, I said, um ""I don't really want to come home from Japan. So if you want me to come home, you can pay for my ticket and buy it and send it to me because I don't care."". laughter Because he at first were like oh look for some tickets, all right. And I said, ""No."". laughter laughter So my dad ur just bought the ticket, and he mailed it to me. So luckily, I did not have to do anything. Uh-huh. . But ur. Yes. laughter laughter Mm. O K. Now lastly, I'm going to show you some pictures. And I'd like you to make up a story. O K. Er let's try this one. laughter O K? So the pictures go this way. Oops sorry. O K. And er this happened before so please start the story with, ""One day last week"". O K. One day last week, ur Bob and Suzie were walking home from the restaurant. And it was raining out. It was raining pretty hard. They both had their umbrellas out. And they were having a conversation. But Bob heard a noise. He sounded a little bit like a dog. laughter Eh but he wasn't sure what it was at first. And he stopped. And Suzie said, ""What is it? What do you hear?"". He said, ""I think there's something over there."". And in the cardboard box sitting next to a building was this little puppy. And since it was raining, the box is all soaking wet, and dog was shivering. And it was very cold, and he just c look completely abandoned. There was no one nearby. And it does didn't look like there was a mother dog or anything. It o obviously looked like somebody just put the dog in this box. And Suzie instantly picked up the dog, and started saying how cute it was. Bob said, ""I don't think our apartment has any room for a dog."". And Suzie said, ""Well they allow pets in our apartment. And the most apartments, they don't. So we're lucky we can have a dog. And we should help him by bringing it back."". And Bob was still not too sure because he knew that raising it would cost money. And especially they found that on the street, they would have to take it to the vet and have it get shots, and make sure it's healthy, and buy specially puppy food. And it would just be a pain in a butt. But she was pretty much ur didn't listen to him at all, and picked up the dog and said, ""We're taking this dog home. And if you don't let me, I'm not gonna kiss you tonight."". And Bob said, ""Oh well O K. Let's bring the dog home, Suzie."". And they took the dog home. And Suzie is planning on keeping the dog, but Bob still hopes to give it to someone else pretty soon. O K. Thanks. So you said you have a girlfriend. Yes. And could you if you don't mind, could you tell me about your last date? Oh yeah. Sure. That's no problem. Um well last time we usually go out alone because her her uh most of the Japanese girls we know are English majors, but she is actually a Chinese major. So she di she like all Japanese students, she learned English from sixth grade to twelfth grade, I think. So she knows it. But she's not studying it, and that's not what she cares about. Um so ur and also, she's not that good at it. laughter She's O K. We can communicate. So usually when we're together, I'll speak Japanese, and she'll speak some English, too. But then if we go out with other Ame because most of my frien uh male friends are Americans. So if we're with them, she feels very left out. And she never really understands what we're saying to each other. So normally she doesn't come with us. Ur but last time we went out, we did. Ur I was talking to her, and she got off her work. And she wanted to uh we wanted to see each other. And we bo we didn't have many ideas because we've been doing a lot of stuff recently. And she remembered that I said I like bowling. And there's a bowling alley near her house, and she didn't want to go far. But going bowling with two people can be kind of boring. So my friend XXX15 who is in the dorm with me, I mentioned him before. Ur it's convenient because we live together, and I said, ""XXX15, let's go bowling."". He said, ""O K."". Again, so we had nothing to do. We don't have laughter you know, we don't have to tell anyone where we're going. So me and him went. And then she called one of her Japanese friends who lives near her house. So the four of us went bowling together. And ended up it was a lot of fun. Because when me and XXX15 were talking, ur XXX16 and XXX17 could talk. And then also we could all talk amongst ourselves. But then nobody felt left out. And with four people, it's much more fun bowling. The problem is ur the girls beat us. They had a higher score. laughter And for a long time, I was not too happy about that. Be it's not it's not ur exactly a male issue because if a girl beats me in some things, I don't mind. Like if I play badminton, that's and then and I lose, that's O K. But I was on a bowling team Oh. in high school. So I care about bowling a lot. But when you bowl, if you don't bowl often, you just forget how and you don't you get worse. So if you used to be good, you can very easily start being bad again. You don't keep being good at bowling. So in my brain, I'm a good bowler. But I actually stink. So I don't bowl very often. So I want to be good, and I remember being very good. So then I bowl and I'm not very good, and it makes me very upset. And she could tell I was kind of mad. laughter I was. I admit it. But it was also because I was bowling bad, and my girlfriend was beating me. It's kind of both. But eventually, um it was O K, and I got over it. I beat XXX15 so that helped. I can understand. Yes. laughter O K. One more. This one. O K? Once again, please make up a story. And start with, ""One day last week"". O K. Mm. Mm one day last week, ur mm Bob was ur got off of work early so he wants to go see his dad. And his dad was retired already so he had time to ur do whatever he wished. And Bob suggested that they go out to a restaurant and catch up on things. So ur the dad wa and Bob both agreed on this one restaurant that they've heard about but haven't been to yet. So they decided to try it out. They go in together, and they see an open table and they by the window, and they like to sit by the window so they can see people passing by. So they go down and sit. And they ord check out the menu, and they order some food and alcohol. Bob has some beer, and his dad has some wine. And they both have some meats. Afterwards, ur his dad pays for the bill which is half the reason Bob wanted to go out with his dad anyway because he knew it would be a free meal. And they were both full and a little bit drunk. And then Bob decided to go see his girlfriend, and sa tell his dad good-bye. And they said good-bye. O K. All right. So urm what's your favorite restaurant like in XXX08? In XXX08? Mh-hmm. I think my favorite restaurant here would be T is Tenya. Ur because ur we don't have food like that in America. There's other restaurants here I enjoy, but I can usually get that food in America, too. I there's two reasons I like Tenya. They really only have one food. Ur you can get tempura. That I think that's mm pretty much all they sell. Urm but I li I like it a lot. And when you get when you get tempura in a cafeteria and the dormitory, it's not very good. And that's excellent. Er and two ur two things, tempura i is delicious. And I think putting the sauce and rice tastes very good. And usually, Japanese people never put sauce on the white rice. But at Tenya, they have a bowl of rice with the tempura on top. And they pour the stuff over it. So the rice has sauce in it. So I can eat sauce rice without getting weird looks. Because often in my cafeteria, if I ever put anything on my rice, I can really tell the Japanese men look at me, and they think I'm insane. So it's a good excuse to get some delicious rice and delicious tempura. And it's not very expensive. And it's also very ur near the station so it's convenient. I I usually go there most often. Uh-huh. O K. Urm when you walk into a Japanese restaurant and you're not quite sure of um the dishes, Hm. how do you decide what to order? Well uh it's it's really useful when they do have the window out front that shows what food they have. If not that, then usually I'm with a Japanese person, and I can ask them. But I am studying Japanese, and I can read Japanese so er if necessary, I read the menu. But even if I can read what it says, ur I might not know what the food is. And again, if I'm with a Japanese person, I usually just ask them. laughter That's mainly ur er just by looking and asking, trying figure out what there is. And then remembering for the next time. Mm. I see. O K. Well urm we're almost finishing up. O K. Yeah. And <.> any plans to have something nice tonight? Mhm. Well ur tonight. Tonight, there's not much going on. Right after this, I have to go study for my history mid-term. Hmm. Ur everyone else in the class has already started. And I said I would come after this which is good, it's O K because they'll have all the answers. And I can go and be like, ""Oh I'm sorry. I'm late but I had to go to that thing. So can I see all your answers?"". And laughter then and they they won't if I showed up, and I had no reason for being late, they might feel weird about it. But they know I wanted to come. So it's a good excuse. Then after that, the movie with XXX15. Right. Then we will return home together. And eat food in the cafeteria together because it's free cafeteria food. Ah. And urm tomorrow night, I'm doing something with my girlfriend. I don't know. After she gets off work. I don't really know what yet. Saturday, karaoke with some other people. We're planning to go all night actually because usually if I go for two hours, it just doesn't seem like enough. So we just wanna rent a room for all night. And get really drunk Hmm. and sing. laughter laughter What's your favorite song now? Well I've been oh ur I don't know many Japanese songs. But I've been here long enough. Mh-hmm. Well er the popular ones, I hear them in stores so often. And I we've been to karaoke enough. Usually, they pick the same songs to sing. And one song I definitely like is ur ""Okina Furudokei,"" Hmm. the the old clock song. And I can sing it now. If I heard it enough so that if I see the words in Japanese, I can sing along. Because I might be able to read the Japanese, but if I don't know the song, there's no way you can sing along. It's too fast. But I've heard it enough now. I can get by, and it usually impresses the Japanese people if I can sing a Japanese song. So I'd like to do that. It's an excellent song, too. Yeah, I agree. laughter O K. So urm thank you so much for coming by today. O K. problem. O K? O K. And urm I hope you have a great stay. O K. Thank you. Yeah. Yes. How how much longer are you gonna be here? Urm I leave right before Christmas, Uh-huh. December twenty-second. Uh-huh. Yeah. And then after that, when you come back, how much longer? Oh ur actu O K, that's when I'm leaving for good. Oh you are. Yeah. O K. So uh I'm leaving mm about November t thirtieth or is my sister's wedding. Then about a month after that, I go home for good. I see. So I didn't wanna go home. It's such a short time, just go to America, then come back for three weeks, and then go back again. Yeah. It's very inconvenient. laughter Well it's your sister's birth ur wedding. laughter That's it's true, it's true. O K. So thanks a lot. O K? O K. Thank you.",0

So almost er in my third month now. Mh-hmm. Do you like living here? I do. I do like XXX06 a lot. It's er it's interesting for a lot of reasons. Yeah. It's very intense in a lot of situations. So there's a lot of people, the hustle and the bustle, erm it's gets tiring sometimes. But it's it's it's been a good experience for sure. I've enjoyed that. So. What do you like most about living in XXX06? Erm just the various things that one can do. Whether you wanna go out or you wanna go to museums or go to erm shows or temples or there's just a lot of things to do. So. Temples? laughter Temples temples. Mm what is so interesting about temples? laughter Erm I think for Westerners, it's just erm well it's something new. It's something different. Er that er certainly in XXX04 and XXX02, there are not a whole lot of er Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. So er it's fun to look around those and learn about those religions. So. O K. All right. And your family is living in XXX02? Er my family is somewhat spread up around the country. My parents still live in XXX02. My erm eldest sister has just moved back to XXX02 and has has started a business. And er my middle sister erm has moved t er to XXX07, XXX08 now, and is in law school. So sort of spread up. And then cousins and uncles live mostly in the XXX09 in XXX04, which is one of the reasons why I decided to go to school there. So. Hmm. O K. Yeah. So XXX04 and XXX02 and XXX06, which is your favorite place? Ah that's a tough question. I like them all for different reasons. Erm when I graduate school this May, I will probably er move back to XXX02. Hm. But if I can find a job in XXX06, I might er I might come back here, too. So Oh. O K. we'll see. Yeah. All right. Yeah. So what do you study in school? Erm I I'm a political science major. So I study my concentration is women in politics er women in American politics specifically. But this semester, I'm studying er Japanese women in politics so which is very interesting. Hm. Er my internship we have part of the XXX10 program is a field placement. And my internship is with erm a member of XXX11 which er a female member of XXX11 which is pretty cool. I'm learning a lot. So it's gone well. I see. O K. All right, XXX01, do you have any hobbies? Erm I do, yeah. I yeah, I used to it's funny, I used to have more hobbies when I had more free time. Er I played soccer for my first two years of college. Erm so I would say sports in general are one of my hobbies. Erm outdoor activities as well. Hiking, camping, erm in the States, I do a lot of fishing. Erm so sports and outdoor activities, perhaps. Are you also also interested in Japanese soccer, J-League? Erm I you know, I don't know much about the J-League. I'm actually going to a game. Erm a friend of mine who does her internship at XXX12 has got some tickets. And so we're gonna go to a J-League game which I'm looking forward to. I see it on T V er once in a while but er I've never caught on to er watching it. Busy with studying. So. laughter Oh you mean in XXX06? You're busy with studies? laughter Yeah, yeah. Very busy. Very busy. Er we're studying in internship and I also am teaching English class on Friday afternoons, erm a a conversation class. So that's also a a little bit time consuming. But it's it's it's fun. I like being busy. So. I see. What do you enjoy most about teaching English? Erm I laughter I enjoy being able to be on the other side of the situation. I've studied foreign languages for a while, and I've never had the experience of teaching a foreign language. And I think it's very beneficial for both my learning and for my teaching style to be able to sit on the other side of that and see what kind of strategies work er in teaching English and erm how students understand it. It's my class is a adult conversation class. So I have erm six people and just focusing on conversation. I do a little bit of grammar erm but mostly just conversation stuff. So it's been good to see how people learn English, because I think it makes it helps me figure out, maybe, how I can be better at learning Japanese. So. I see. But it's hard. laughter laughter O K. It's real it's really hard. All right. So first thing today, please look at this picture. Oops. O K. And please describe this picture for me. Erm O K. I see a girl, probably a student in her erm I would assume, a dorm room. She is er has a dog and a cat. A pretty small room. Erm has a large stereo system, a phone, a lot of books. Erm the dog and the cat are both sleeping. She seems to be working at her computer, possibly presenting something. Erm it looks as though she's talking or she's facing her two animals, but they don't really seem to be paying attention to her. Erm the door is open. Er there's a calendar, a clock on the wall. Um most resembling a dorm room to me. Hm. Hm. O K. All right. So XXX01, Hm. er have you ever had a pet? Have I ever had a pet? Uh-huh. Yes, I've had a pet. Hm. What kind of animal did have? Erm we had we've always had dogs when I was growing up. We had erm a golden retriever when I was a baby. And most of my young life, we had a black Lab. Erm and she actually passed away last year.

And and in a Japanese house, it's, I think, hard for the dog and for the owners to have a big large dog.

So the dog gets very hyper when it is let out of its cage, er and er runs around and knocks things over and. He's very cute. But er seems to be a little er little out of control sometimes. So.

So in summer, what do you usually do? What do you enjoy most? Er. laughter laughter What I'd like to do is what I well it's different from what I actually do do. Erm when I was a kid, I used to go to camps and go on vacation with the family. But towards the end of high school and certainly in college, erm I usually work. I've always worked. Erm last summer, I did research with the professor at my college and erm lived in XXX04. Er in my free time during the summer, I went camping, took some road trips with my friends. Erm er let's see. Did did a lot of stuff. Hang out with my family a little bit. My cousin's in the area. Erm I also pain I helped my cousin paint his house which was a a pretty big task. Uh-huh. Erm but usually working. I would say ur summers are usually time for work. Er the previous summer, I lived in XXX02. And I interned for a er consulting company. So I was working erm forty hours a week there. And I also worked at a restaurant two nights a week. Wow. laughter That was really busy. But it was to save money. Erm so actu actually that summer, I didn't just work. I went to Europe for three weeks. Hm. So that's why I worked so much on the first part of the summer, so I could go travel. Hm. So. Where in Europe did you go? Erm we a friend and I went to erm we went all over. We flew in I flew into London. We met in London and went to Prague. Er from Prague, we went to er mm Vienna, we went to er Rome, and Milan, and then we went to Brussels on our own. Wow. So yeah, we were busy. It was a lot of fun. laughter It was a lot of fun, I tell you. So. Hmm. And then I went back to school in the fall. laughter So and that wasn't so much fun. laughter laughter So. O K. All right. So lastly, well O K. This is a picture sequence. O K. And there are four pictures from one to four. And please make up a story based on these four pictures. O K. Er Cindy and Al had a date. They went to the zoo. They met in front of the zoo. And they saw many different kinds of animals. First, they saw the lions. And then they visited er the monkey cages. In the meantime, er Cindy bought an ice cream cone. And er they had a g they had a really good time. They spent about two hours at the zoo. And then they er left and said good-bye to each other. Hm. And had a really good time. O K. Er have you been to the zoo laughter in Japan? Er I haven't, unfortunately, been to the zoo yet in Japan. laughter Hm. Erm I have been many times in the United States. But I haven't been yet in Japan. Hmm. So I'd like to go. O K. I haven't been to Disneyland either, though. So I ge Ohh. I have to I have to do that, too. Er. O K. Did you go to Disneyland in Los Angeles or Florida? Erm I went let's see, I've actually been to both when I was a kid. I went to the one in Los Angeles once, and then I went to we were in Florida visiting my grandparents and we went to erm Epcot Center for a day, which is part of Disney World, as they say. So but I haven't been in Tokyo yet. So I'd like to I'd like to go soon. But it's expensive, isn't it? It's very expensive. Yeah. So. Hm. O K. And what is the most popular thing to do for a date in the United States for especially college students? Ahh. That's a tough question. Erm most popular for college students would probably be go to a restaurant or go to a movie erm or go out, maybe, for drinks, for beers and maybe some food. Erm let's see. First dates, I usually er laughter I usually go out to dinner. Hmm. Go out to dinner and then maybe for drinks afterwards. So. Yeah. I don't know about the zoo. I don't laugher I don't think many people go on a first date to the zoo. laughter Right. O K. Er there is another picture. O K. O K. Please make up a story based on these pictures. Erm O K. Looks like three people or three friends have decided to go to a movie together. Erm they bought their tickets for the one o'clock show. They went into the theater, bought some popcorn and candy and sodas. Erm they went into the movie. It was a violent movie. There was planes crashing. Erm probably a sad movie, I would assume, if there was planes crashing. Erm er it looks like as they're en leaving the theater, they really enjoyed it. They thought it was a great movie. Erm I don't really understand why. But maybe it was very entertaining or maybe it was a good story. Maybe everyone has survived probably everyone has survived the plane crash and that's why they were so happy when they er leave. But they enjoyed the movie nonetheless. Hm. So. O K. laughter All right. XXX01, er what kind of movies do you like? Erm I'm not much of a moviegoer myself. But erm I I like various kinds. I'm a big fan of action movies. Erm or I used to be, I guess. My taste is sort of evolving, er I would say. Erm comedies I enjoy comedies, some dramas lately, I think there has been some really good movies. But er er but I honestly, I haven't seen a movie yet in Japan, and I can't remember the last last movie I saw in the United States. Really. Erm I actually enjoy renting movies more than going to them. So. So what are some advantage of renting a movie instead of going to movie theater? Ah well obviously, it's cheaper and that's why I usually do it. Erm <.> I think too erm I like reading the reviews and seeing, and hearing from my friends and people that I know if they enjoyed it. And if they enjoyed it, then I'd go out and rent it rather than just listen to all the hype and then go to see a movie at the theater. Erm and plus you can watch it, you know, in convenience. You can watch it twice if you want. You can stay up late. You can watch it in the afternoon. You're not set by anybody else's schedule. So. Hmm. And you can stay at home. laughter You don't have to go out, if you I mean which is nice sometimes. Hm. So. Who is your favorite actor or actress? Wow. That's a tough question, too. I don't know if I have a favorite. Er <.> I really love Julia Roberts for a numerous reasons. I think she's a great actress. Erm I love some of a lot of her movies, in fact. So I would say Julia Roberts at this point. Hmm. What's so attractive about her? Erm well she is very attractive. laughter And I also just think she's a really talented actress. I think she picks really good roles. Hm. Er in her interviews, she's very down to earth. And erm she i I think she is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood, but is still very er down to earth and rational, and seems like someone that I would enjoy talking with. So. Hm. So <.> yeah. So er what's your favorite movie of Julia Roberts'? Er probably ""Pretty Woman"". Because erm it's just the first one that pops into my mind. I think she played a really good role. I also liked Richard Gere in that movie. I thought he was good. Er so, yeah, ""Pretty Woman"". Hm. An old movie but a good one. O K. All right. Thank you. Sure. We have come to almost the end O K. of the interview. So what are yo what are your plans for today this afternoon? Er this afternoon, I have er two more classes. I had one class this morning. I've two more this afternoon. Er I have my politics class and then tonight, I have my international business communication class. So just basically sitting in class today. And then after that, erm I'll go home, eat dinner with the host family, er do a little bit of Japanese homework and go to bed go to bed So. But wh where do you study? Here? Er uh I sometimes I study at the XXX10 center or XXX16. But I usually er study at home. Hm. Hm. So. Yeah. O K. Er is your host family nice to you? laughter laughter They are very nice. They spoil me. They laughter er they treat me really well. I'm er so thankful for it. Er they are very welcoming and er yeah, cook great food and er do my laundry. I insisted I insisted I'd do it and help clean up. But they er they don't let me help out. So. laughter Oh. Do you talk to them in Japanese or in English? Er in Japanese. In Japanese. Er. Hm it's a very good practice. It is good practice. I've er I've learned er don't tell any of my teachers this, but I've learned more er Japanese from my host family than I learn in my Japanese class, I think. Er em so yeah, Hm. they're great. They're really great. O K. All right. Thank you very much for coming. O K. No problem. This is the end. Thank you.",0

I've been to a few, but not in I guess apparently, I guess in Japan, they don't have them at the people's houses, because they're small, so they so I've gone out to like to izakayas and things like that.

It depends on my mood. It's different. Yeah. Like, you can drink wine with dinner, but I think sake, you just don't really have food, I don't know. You drink it on its own. I don't know if that's true. laughter laughter I'm speculating entirely. I think Japanese beer is stronger than American beer. Maybe. I don't like beer. I don't drink that I don't drink beer.

So you can get a cab or a subway to the lower to the erm maybe XXX18 or down in the XXX19. And you can walk around and look at the shops. And they have cute little markets down there.

And and uh what else? Mm uh well XXX22 has a is really beautiful. And um and then yeah, and then you can go uptown and they have nice restaurants up in like the Seventies and the Eighties, the XXX24.

All right. cough Excuse me. Ah here is a picture sequence. And please make up a story based on these six pictures. sniff O K. Well one day last week, I looked in the refrigerator. Oh no, I'll make a better start. One day last week, I came home from work and I was starving. So I raced for the refrigerator and flung it open, but it was empty. laughter And I couldn't believe it that I didn't have any food. So I decided that even though I was tired and it was freezing outside, I would go oh it's not that cold actually. She's wearing a short skirt, O K, and it and it's nice outside. I would go to the supermarket. So I went outside and I got in my little green car and zipped over to the supermarket. I opened the door and got out. And I picked up some things from the shelf, and they had my favorite cereal on sale, so so I grabbed that. And and I got some steak, also, for dinner. sniff And on my way out, I paid the woman at the counter. I loaded everything up into the trunk of my car. And then I went home. Oh maybe I bought eggs, I guess. I bought eggs. And then I went home and fried an egg and ate it, and it was great. Hm. O K. All right. Thank you. So er where do you usually buy food in XXX04 er XXX05? I usually buy food there's a supermarket er around the corner. sniff Hm. Could you tell me more about the supermarket? Yeah. I can. Well there's erm it's not a very big supermarket compared to American standards. Or even to compared to Japanese standards, it's not very big. But erm um food is really expensive in Japan. laughter Food is very expensive. Um so usually, I buy erm I buy oni onigiri for lunch, and I buy yogurt and bread. And I like to look at all the fish. I like to walk around and look at the fish counters because in America, they you'd never just have a whole fish just like lying out there. And eh sometimes I like just go to, like, poke the fish. laughter laughter Erm I like. Yeah. And I'm er I usually sniff want to buy some sort of um like mochi or sweet or something. But since I'm a vegetarian, I end up having these, like extensive conversations with the people who work there about like if it has niku in it, or if it has meat, of if it's vegetarian. And I usually like end up talking to these people forever trying to find out if something has meat. But so they all know me. laughter I'm like the annoying American who doesn't eat meat. But laughter yeah, that's the supermarket. laughter O K. So y laughter you but you mentioned you like sushi. Then. I really, I like sushi. I eat fish. O K. All right. It's a r it's a religious thing. So. Hmm. I don't eat meat, but I eat fish. Yep. Have you seen any difference between American sushi and Japanese sushi? Not really. We erm well they have toro here which, in America, we always want it. My dad really likes it, and we always ask for it, but I guess they don't eat it in in America. I don't know why. That's the only difference. Hmm. Yeah. And maybe price? Price is the same? I guess they're about the same. It's about the same. Well it depends on you know, it depends on where you go, if you go to a fancy place or. It's about the same. Oh you know what they have here though, which they don't have in America is um they it's like it's fish, eh not ikura but it's like b pink like fish eggs. It's like a uu a clump of fish eggs. Anyway, yeah. Ah I see. Yeah. laughter laughter They don't we don't really have that. Hm. Hm. Hm. Well maybe we do, I don't know. But it's about the same. It looks grotesque, a little bit. laughter laughter I really don't like here. Oh no, I don't I like it, I don't mind. laughter O K. All right. So there is another picture. Please make up a story. This time, there are only four pictures. O K. <..> Well the guy in front of me um I wan I wanted to go to the movies and I was waiting on line for so long. And the guy in front of me was taking so long that finally, I raised my arm and I yelled at him to hurry up and buy his ticket so that I wouldn't be late for my movie. And so and I got finally, I bought my ticket and I got inside to the movie theater. And erm I went to the counter to buy some popcorn for my friend and I. And I bought popcorn. And laughter and we watched the movie. And it was really scary, about a plane blowing up. And so my friends I were my friend and I were erm <.> were yeah, we thought it was a good movie. And then we left and we were really happy that we. laughter Yeah. That's it. O K. All right. So what kind of movies do you usually watch? Funny movies. Hmm. Or comedies or romance. Mmm. Romantic comedies, comedies. Why do you like them? I I like it because it makes me laugh. I like to laugh. laughter I like comedies. I'm like s sometimes I like scary movies but not at night and not if I'm alone. I can't handle it. I'm a wuss. laughter O K. So who is your favorite actor or actress? Oh Audrey Hepburn, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". Hmm. The greatest all time ever. She's great. It's a classic. Yes. I love it, I love it. Hmm. What's so attractive about her, Audrey Hepburn? About her? Oh she's just so simple and and uh but I think in the movie, well she's s has this like simple, beautiful grace, but she also has funny quirks about her that make her m more lovable than just a she's not she's not unattainable. She's she's like a normal, funny person, but she's she's great. I love her. laughter Hmm. O K. So and you mentioned you er you have you have a membership in some rental video shop here? laughter Yeah. Hm. And do you rent a lot of video? I do. laughter laughter I do. Um if my host mo if my host mom comes home late, I usually just rent a movie while I'm waiting. Um yeah, I do. Hmm. laughter I usually rent old movies from the eighties that I've never heard of before. Like old random American movies that. Sometimes they have a lot of like weird old movies from the eighties that I've never heard of, so Hmm. I got those. I ju I started to get movies in Japan I mean in Japanese. When I first got here, I rented ""There's Something About Mary"" in Japanese. But I didn I couldn't I don't like it. laughter I was very determined. I was like, ""Oh I'll rent Japanese movies and learn Japanese,"" but huh laughter it didn't work out so well. Now I get English. laughter laughter Er did you use to rent a lot of video when you were in the United States, too? No, I didn't rent. Oh. No. Why not? I did sometimes. Maybe Satur like on the weekend with a friend. Hm. But I had a lot to do. Like uh when I in America, I studied a lot. And I and I went out with friends a lot. Here, I think if once I go home, like most people go just go to their host families and like they don't hang out at night. So Hmm. there's not much to do. And I don't really get that much homework yet. So I watch movies every night. laughter laughter Yeah. O K. All right. So we have come to almost the end O K. of the interview.

"N_file00007.txt 2002-11-07 male 22 USA 1_12m Economics electric shop ski travel_intermediate shopping_intermediate invitation_intermediate department store stray cat O K. Let's begin. So hello. My name is XXX01. May I have your name, please? Erm my name is XXX02. Mh-hmm. How are you today? I'm doing well. How are you too? laughter Good. Were you about to say something? No. Oh O K. laughter . Erm. So how do you like XXX03? It's a a fun city. It's really large, though. Um it takes a long time to get from place to place, but I've found it to be a nice place to live and safe, for the most part. All right. Good. Erm. laughter Which part do you like especially? sigh I don't know if I have a favorite part of XXX03. There like it just depends on what I want to do. If I want to find something ni er electronics, I'll go to Akihabara. If I want, I don't know, to see temples, I'll go to different wherever they are laughter I go to Asakusa or some place like that. I don't know if I have a a favorite, uh like any real, <.> like, I I guess, like favorite spots to go or places to go or something <.> like that. laughter Mh-hmm. I see. So you like to see temples? Sometimes. laughter Yeah? That's just an example. laughter But like hmm. Well you've been to Akihab er Asakusa, right? I've been to Asakusa. I've I've. Mh-hmm. Can you tell me what you saw there? O K. I saw erm um er Asakusa the the temple in Asakusa, and the shopping district around it, as well as the river. Erm <.> I believe I even tried to eat there, but couldn't get into a restaurant. Why not? It was full. Oh. laughter laughter And then and that's what I did. That's about it. Sorry. <.> Yeah. Erm I can't remember a lot of places I went, so that's why I picked Asakusa. Oh. laughter Names are hard. Uh-huh. laughter So. O K. O K. So erm you're in a program here. But I don't know much about it. Can you tell me more? The XXX04 which stands for XXX04 well the XXX04, erm which is an A American program Hm. which has different centers abroad. Mh-hmm. And each of those centers accept students, and then has a core curriculum in which people in which the students will take classes and also other er center-sponsored activities as well. Erm in XXX04, there's three centers in Japan that I know of, here, and XXX05 and somewhere else that I can't remember Mh-hmm. at the moment. Erm the center is unique because it has field placement program and which it allows us to go to field placement every Wednesday and in XXX03, and wor at a company or at a temple or erm at a non-profit orga some some place to get a an an extra experience. So you sort of get a a full er view of what life in Japan really is like. Erm <.> XXX04 s mm started, I think, as the Institute for European Studies, so there are many European centers. But they changed it when they went to more to oh to other continents. So. Mh-hmm. To more diverse locations. Hm. So what do you do in your field placement? I work at XXX06, Hm. which is the the largest broadcasting network in Japan, and also the one that has cartoons. Hm. laughter I do I did research on the video game industry for them <.> earlier, and now I'm researching I'm doing in in the U S, and then I'm doing now, I'm doing the research on the the animation industry in the U S, as well as the the cable and er satellite broadcasting systems as well. <.> Yeah. cough Hm. What's interesting about this industry? Cartoons. I like cartoons. laughter Hmm. Right. So why And and games and stuff. why? Why? They're fun. laughter laughter They're fun for me. Uh-huh. I don't know. And <.> I don't know. Every year, I try to go younger. And so <.> I don't know. In high school, I was, like, I was too old for Saturday morning cartoons, but in college, I was like, ""I'm gonna wake up early and watch Saturday morning cartoons."". Mh-hmm. Because in the U S, we get Saturday morning cartoons. Uhm. Uh-huh. laughter So yeah, so that's the earliest day I wake up, is Saturday. For cartoons. laughter O K. So tell me about your favorite cartoon. <.> Right now, what's my favorite cartoon? <.> If you have to choose one. I don't have <.>. I don't know. Maybe right now, it's ""Ranma"". laughter Really? Which is Japanese. Uh-huh. Very famous Japanese cartoon that, I don't know, involves various people who fall into cursed springs, in jusenkyo and become, well in Ranma's case, a girl, and his his father's case, a panda. laughter laughter And and and then, another girl er in Shampoo's case, it's a cat. And Ryoga is becomes a pig. And Mousse becomes a duck. And well when they get splashed with cold water, they become these things. And when and when then they get splashed with warm water, they become normal again. Hmm. laughter O K. laughter All right. So um other than watching cartoons on T V, what do you do in your free time here? Erm I explore occasionally, and I study a lot. I don't have I don't feel like I have that much free time, because I have a lot of work to do. laughter Erm <.> sometimes I go to the movies, which are expensive here, or just hang out and talk with friends. Hmm. Erm. Yeah. O K. So could you describe one person you've met here? Japanese or other? Anyone. A friend that you've made here. Erm <.> sure. Er yes. A good friend of mine that I've met is XXX07, and she's from <.> XXX03. laughter Mh-hmm. And she I met her last March, when I was here right before school began. And she had er er the medical <.> exam for school that I guess all Japanese people have to go through every year or something. So we ended up at lunch table together somehow. And so I met her. She's really nice. She er spent a year abroad in the United States, in XXX08, which I feel sorry for her, because I don't think inner city XXX08 is the best example of the United States. laughter Mhm. But she still had a very good time. And we tend to get along very well. I don't know, she's about, I don't count how many centimeters, because I'm not Japanese and I think in feet, so I guess maybe five-two or something, which won't make any sense to the people listening to this tape. I'm really sorry. laughter And, no, she's, I guess, Japanese which I guess that fits the rest of description I could possibly say. I can't be like blond hair and blah, blah, blah. Hm. Because like in America, you're like, ""Well what's her hair color?"". It's like, ""Red."". And then, like, in Japan, ""What's her hair? "". ""It's, you know, like everyone else's."". And then. laughter O K. laughter All right. We're going to move on. I'm going to show you a picture. Um here's something you might like. Er can you tell me what you see in this picture? I see someone who doesn't know what he wants. And he's hanging out in the electronics store. And I think he's pointing to a selection of watches. And the store clerk is showing him, I guess, a selection of watches. But then again, I could be wrong. It could be the telephone or answering machine or w a fax machine underneath. Also in this picture is a T V, a bigger T V, a radio, a bigger radio with C Ds, and something that I don't know what it is, but it looks like it's a T V and a whole stereo system with big, big speakers. And er I don't know how they're gonna move that out of that store, but it might move. It looks like a store. laughter Oh I bet. And I guess it would be an electronics store, because there're all electronics in this picture, and like C D players and radios and phones and camcorders and cameras. But it could be part of a big department store, in a small section. Erm it's currently three o'clock in the store, laughter erm at least according to the wall. I'm guessing that would be three in the afternoon, because no store I know of is opened at three A M, unless it's Wal-Mart. But then again, they close their electronic store at twelve. laughter O K. I don't know. laughter Erm so could you compare urm <.> an electronics store in the States and in Japan? You said you went to Akihabara here. Mh-hmm. An electronics store in the States is u well I guess a great example of electronics store in the U S would be Circuit City or Best Buy, which are <.> very big, open spaces with lots and lots and they they keep all their basically, they keep all their boxes up on top of all the stuff they're displaying. So it's like like walking into a warehouse, whereas in Japan, it's like walking into someone's house, I guess. It's like really small, you know. Mh-hmm. And like you don't know where they keep all their stuff. Right. And and it's usually I don't know, in Akihabara, there're like several floors. The Laox is like the Laox in Makuhari, that's a bit more American, except it has two floors. In America, we'd have the same amount of space, except take the top floor out and have the ceiling. laughter laughter I see. You know what store it is. Erm <.> we don't also we don't like to park our cars on top of electronics stores. And we like to park them out front. And. Why why is that? Because we have plenty of parking . laughter I see, O K. laughter laughter All right. Erm the next picture. Describe this. All right. They're skiing. Erm it's <.> O K, there are people skiing. There's some guy that's trying to ski downhill backwards. I guess he is an instructor trying to teach people how to ski. And I'm really scared for them, because another person who looks like they don't really know how to ski is gonna run into them. And then there's a person who knows how to ski, and then there's a person who just wiped out. And he er he jus he has what we call a a yard sale, where laughter in skiing, a yard sale is when you wipe out and you lose all your equipment in the process. laughter I don't know if that's a complete expression in all of the U S or not. But we use it. And then there's a guy snowboarding. And there's a ski lift and a a ski lodge restaurant sort of thing which has skis and a snowboard oh rack, I guess, er outside. And a snowman, which has only one arm, uh an injured snowman, I guess. And er <.> he the snowman is made with two big snowballs and a bucket for a hat. And then there's a a big machi like, vehicle. I don't know what it is. But it's made for the snow, because it has snow treads on it. And then there are kids playing, or having a snowball fight, which consists of picking up snow, making it into a ball, and then throwing it at someone else, preferably someone you don't like that much. laughter laughter O K. So what sports do you do, if any? I play squash. Ah. I see. Erm how did you learn that? I learned it in high school. And it doesn't involve the vegetable squash, it involves a a small, black ball that doesn't bounce. But you use a tennis racket and hit - uh not a tennis - a squash racket. It's like a tennis racket and a badminton racket <.> which doesn't make very much sense. But if you had uh to pick a ur if you had to fuse a tennis racket and a badminton racket, you would get a squash racket. Hm. It's like halfway in between the two. So you use a squash racket. And you use a stroke that's similar to badminton, and you're in a room that's similar to a racquetball room except it's well a court, except it's smaller. Squash has two different sizes of court. They have the international court, which everybody uses. And then there's the American court, because the Americans like to feel special and use their own court, except we don't use it anymore. Uh-huh. laughter Oh . The international court came first. The Americans made their own court, and then decided that it's silly to have our own court. And we all went to the international court, which is two feet wider and has it's like having a slanted line on the side that has i it has stairstepping lines. Hm. And it's a, quite a bit more challenging to play on. Have to be a little more fit. Er squash is the the second-mo requires the second-most endurance of any sport in the world behind water polo, which is understandable. Erm well I if the ball doesn't bounce, then it's for you have to do a lot of running. Right? laughter Erm <.> it its points last on an average of twenty seconds, which is why it's so you basically, it's running for twenty seconds. In twenty-second interview in er intervals, for about <.> a couple of hours in a match. So that's well it's it's real hard, when you're good. I'm not. I've never been that good, but I wish I was. Hm. My university doesn't have squash, so I haven't played very much. And I joined the squash circle here. And it's fun. But they don't really play squash. They sort of go on to a squash court and hit the ball. Oh. laughter laughter I see. No rules or anything. laughter laughter Ah. It's a circle. laughter Uh-huh. O K. So we're going to we're going to do some role-plays now. O K. And I'll give you a card and I want you to read it. And er <.> when you're ready, let me know. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? Mh-hmm. May I help you? Yes. I would like to travel to China on Easter. Uh-huh. Mm-hm. Er is Easter important in China? In China? Mm not really. No. O K. But I still want to go to China, er preferably, I guess, Shanghai. And I was thinking, you know, the <.> like first week in er like, first week in April or so. Erm <.> O K. Yeah. We have several em packages as well as <.>. Is Shanghai pretty in April? laughter Pardon. Is Shanghai pretty in April? I don't know very. Eh. <.> You know, I haven't er haven't been to China before and I was thinking it'd be a a a pretty neat place to go. Hm. Especially because it's becoming more and more important er to people nowadays. And I'm an economics major, so I was thinking I'd go. And I heard Shanghai was a big economic center. sniff And I I I think a trip would be would be good. Erm. Sure. It it should be pretty warm, and and the flowers should be blooming and things like that. Uh-huh flowers are blooming? So. Yeah. That sounds. Pretty. So erm <.> erm uu so what is the flight availability to from er Atlanta to Shanghai? Well there are two flights every day. Erm er what about like on the flights, do we have er what classes can I get in the in the prices er? O K. Erm. Well we have all three classes, economy, business, and first class. O K? So I don't know what your budget is. I have no budget. Ah. Er I mean I have budget is not a concern of mine. So I want I want to stay I so I will fly in first class and I want stay in a very nice hotel in Shanghai. O K. So we can put a package together. O K? Erm what are the uh I guess I would like also to see some scenic spots and be able to. Is there a sort of a package I can get where I could, like, view the sights around the town as far as the and mm possibly even go out to the country and and sort of get a better view of of the countryside? Sure. Sure. There are some trips that go to different cities. <.> And <.> O K. Oh that sounds good. Yeah? Yeah. O K. So I'll put this all together and I'll send you information. Is that all right? Yeah. That sounds very good. I'll look forward to the packet. O K. Thank you. Thank you. So I'll make the reservation. O K. So that's end of the role-play. All right. So are you really interested in er going to Shanghai? I am. Erm I talked to my mom the other night, and she said that I had gotten in the mail this thing that offered to let me go to Shanghai for seventeen days next summer erm for an international business conference or something Hmm. like that. Hm. It sounded pretty neat. I've met erm several Chinese people here and they are very nice. And a couple of them live in Shanghai, so I might take the opportunity. Hopefully, they'll be in town and I'll be able to say hi to them. Er also, as I've been in Japan, I've become more and more interested in in seeing the surrounding countries and seeing more of Asia. I see. Hm. Hm. What do you want to do there, other than go to the conference? I don't know what's there. Oh. I <.> I jus it's it's hard to say what I want to do when I don't know very much about <.> China or the city of Shanghai. So. Hm. All right. Um and next role-play is this one. The interviewee is reading the card. Hm. I lost my C D player the other day, and I I need to get a new one. Uh-huh. And I need to get one that's cheap. Uh-huh. Because in the U S, I can get one for about ten dollars, or, which is about a thousand yen. Uh-huh. And I was hoping I could get one for about a thousand yen here. Uh-huh. So what manufacturer's C D what C D players do you have for a thousand yen, if any? Er I don't think we have any for a thousand yen. Really? Yeah. Ah that's too bad. But er what is the cheapest C D player that you have? Two thousand five hundred yen. <.> We have two types. Two types? Mh-hmm. Oh. What are the difference between the the two types? The advantages and disadvantages of buying it, or are they the same? Hm. Well they look similar. But one is waterproof and the other one isn't. So if I wanted to go scuba diving, the waterproof one. Mh-hmm. How m eh what depth does i is it waterproof to? You can go fifty feet. Fifty feet? Yeah. That's pretty good. Hm. A waterproof C D player, that goes to fifty feet. I can even use that in the swimming pool. That's right. Hm. And so the other one does it's not waterproof. Is that the only thing i that's different between the two, that one is waterproof and one isn't? Well the other one is scratchproof. laughter laughter Given the state of my room, I might want the scratchproof one. Uh-huh. Because, I don't know, I tend to lose things and break things, and generally, they fall apart. So if I have one that's scratchproof, and it will always look nice. Right. For twenty-five dollars? Right. That's something else. It's a bargain. That is a bargain for sure. So but I can't scuba dive with it. No. laughter Well that's tough. Hm. Because I do have this scuba diving license that I got when I was fourteen. Uh-huh. And, uh I do I don't know. I've never thought about listening to mm like, I don't know, J-pop while I scuba dive. So. . Right. I don't know, I'll take the waterproof one. O K. Great. So here you are. Thank you very much. laughter laughter You're welcome. End of this role-play. O K. laughter So laughter laughter erm you listen to J-pop? Yes, I do. Well what kind? From time to time. Erm What do you listen to? pop the erm the J-pop from Japan. Er laughter er Mai Kuraki is I like her her er music. And Ayumi Hawasaki and <.> Utada Hikaru. It's it's getting harder to say names now. laughter I don't know the names well. Uh-huh. But yeah. Hm. I like their music. I <.> I are you uh it's the only way I can get new music now anyway. And it's really pretty. I like listening to it. Erm so it tends to get mixed in with all the old music I had from before March, when I was in the U S. So and I don't really notice now that they're speaking Japanese I guess, but I like it. laughter O K. So when you don't understand what they're saying, what do you do? How do you try to understand it? Well I like listening to the music. When I was a little kid, and the music was in English, I had no idea what they were saying, and I still liked it. So it's sort of the same thing. You know, that growing down, watching cartoons, listening to music, I have no idea what it means, it's O K. Hm. But I do, from time to time, open up the booklet and s try to to see what it says, because it's really nice in Japan, because they put all the lyrics, Mh-hmm. even though it's in kanji. Hm. But they put all the lyrics in the in the little booklet that comes with the C D. And, though, one of them had hiragana er furigana. I was so happy. Hm. It made my day. I see. And and I could read, so I could sort of read it. But I haven't really taken the time to look up every single kanji I uu have seen in the in all the songs. But some of them, I do O K understanding it, for the most part. I see. O K. The next one. laughter laughter Yeah. I have to read this side? Oh sorry. This side. laughter The interviewee is reading the card. O K. cough O K. So this is a phone conversation. Right. So ring, ring. Hello? This is XXX01. Ring. Hi, XXX01. Erm I was wondering if you'd like to go to the movies. Sure. Erm yeah. O K. The one's at er ho can you go to IKS IKSPIARI in er at Maihama Station, which is basically the Disney movie theater? Are you free this weekend? Do I go. Yeah. I'm free. Uh-huh. Mh-hmm. Erm how about seeing er ""Lilo and Stitch""? Do you wanna see ""Lilo and Stitch""? I'm not sure what that is. It's a Disney cartoon. Uh-huh. It's really, really, really, really good. Uh-huh. And when I was at home, Uh-huh. At the U S in August, I watched it three times. Uh. . Eh which costs the same as watching it once in Japan. Which is. Uh-huh. If you already watched it, maybe something else is better. No, but it's my favorite movie of all time. Oh oh uh uh uh no. Have you seen it? Are you sure? No. I haven't seen it. Oh O K. O K. We can go. Yeah, are you sure you wanna go? Sure. Really? Yeah. Really, really? Yeah, yeah. O K. Er when are you free? Erm around three. Three? This Saturday? Yes. O K. So O K, I'll meet you at three at er actually, er at three o'clock at Maihama Station erm by train. laughter I'm not familiar with Maihama Station. It's on the the Keiyo Line. Uh-huh. Between Tokyo and Soga, which doesn't really help, because every stop on the Keiyo Line is between Tokyo and Soga. Right. laughter Is it a big erm station? But it's it's big enough, because you can take the rapid. O K. And the rapid doesn't stop at every station between Soga and Tokyo. And I don't know where you're coming from, but hopefully you can get to either Tokyo or Soga. And Soga is only, like, two stops from Chiba on another line that I don't know of. Oh. O K. And that's like, if you can get to Chiba, you can get anywhere. Ah. Well that's the same with Tokyo. So er like. I'll manage. Yeah, thanks. laughter O K. So I'll see you on Saturday? O K. Yeah. O K. Thanks for calling. Bye. That's the end of that role-play. O K. So erm hm laughter laughter do you usually go out with friends? I do. Yeah. All right. From time to time. And see movies. All right. What else? At. Uh. I've been to too many movie theaters in Japan. And it's gonna make me broke. laughter Hm. What else do you do with them? Erm we go have dinner sometimes. And sometimes we have study sessions laughter when we have tests. laughter And is that just in Japan? Or can I go to the U S? What do I do with my friends in the U S, is that O K? O K. We have this thing called putt-putt, Mh-hmm. which is miniature I don't know, I've never seen miniature golf in Japan. But it's where you you get you know, um with golf, you you you hit the ball and you try to get it into the hole. But at the very end, you have the green, and you hit the ball on the green - from the green into the hole. Basically, putt-putt is only the part with the green. Except, though, they put really strange things in your way, like the Eiffel Tower, or a small version of it, or a like a big <.> rock or something, so that it's really hard to get from where you start to where the hole is. Er sometimes or even like things like windmills that constantly change so you have to time it. It's sort of fun. And then we also do go-carts. Do you have go-carts in Japan? I think so. Really? Cool. O K. Go-carts are fun. They're like cars, except smaller. And you race. And then, yeah. And all kinds of fun stuff. Sometime I eh here, I've gone to Disney. I can't get my friends to go to a theme park in the U S, so but I like going to Disney and riding all the the rides and the roller coasters, though Disney has really bad roller coasters. Because they don't have loops and corkscrews and make you go upside-down. laughter I see. But they're still fun. Mh-hmm. Sure. O K. Erm laughter laughter let's see. <.> O K. Now I'm going to show you some pictures, and I want you to make up a story. laughter All right? Something drops on the floor. This. O K. O K? And the pictures go this way. And er this happened last week. So please start your story with, ""One day last week"". So this erm woman, her name is Meg. She er she went to the department store because she was thinking of how wonderful it would be to have get a tie for her husband, Tom, because his birthday was coming up and in a couple of days. So she went in, and she er she found the perfect tie and bought it from the the store clerk. And sigh uh-oh she <.> she happened to see the final sale, thirty percent off on the shoes that she'd been eyeing for three months. And she was like, ""I know I shouldn't get them. But."". And you know, of course, what happened was Meg got the shoes. And then the next store, er the next wa on the way out was fifty percent off on the on on the perfect blouse. And that blouse was great because it would go with his tie. And it had a a matching skir it had a skirt. And together, it would go with the tie and then they could match on his birthday. And and they could go to the movies. But she shouldn't get it she shouldn't spend any more, because she just bought those shoes she'd been eyeing for three months. She she she broke down and got them anyway. And then as she went on through the department store, she found more and more things. And she walked out as she walked out, she was thinking, ""I'm glad this is my husband's credit card."". That's the end of the story. laughter Oh that's good, thank you. All right. So you mentioned that she was gonna go celebrate her husband's birthday. Mh-hmm. Hm. How do you usually celebrate your birthday? I don't celebrate my birthday, usually. Not at all? No. How about your friends? My friends, sometimes they celebrate their birthdays. Mh-hmm. Er they'll go have dinner and they'll have cakes and <.> I don't know. Erm just they wanna be with their friends. So some sometimes I'm there. Sometimes I don't know about it, and I can't go. laughter Hm. It's sad. But I like celebrating their birthdays if they wanna celebrate them. But I usually, like this year, I didn't tell anybody, really, when my birthday was. So no one knew, and I just went on like it was a normal day. Had class and had a test. Hm. No, I had a fake test on my birthday. laughter You know what a fake test is? No. That's when you're supposed to have a test, but your teacher forgets it. laughter laughter So you study all of it, you know, you spend like three hours studying the night before when you could be watching ""Ranma One-half"" laughter with your friend who's never seen it before. And you know, so all that time studying and you get to the class, and he forgot it. And it's almost the big letdown, except then you're happy, because you don't have to take a test that day. But then you're not, because then you have to study all over again the next weekend, because you know, between Thursday and Monday, which is the next class, you're gonna forget all those kanji. Hmm. laughter And so you're gonna have to relearn them on Sunday and it's gonna take another three hours. It's tough. Yeah, it's really tough. It was a fake test. He's done it to us twice. laughter laughter O K. Now, lastly, um er another picture sequence. Uh-huh. So again, make up a story and start with, ""One day last week"". Erm <.> One day last week, <.> erm Ted and Molly were walking along, talking, when all the sudden, Ted heard this meowing sound coming from a box, ""Meow, meow."" It was like. And Molly looked over and she went and there was a cat. And Ted does not like cats. In fact, he so doesn't like cats that he's allergic to cats, but he's really not. He just wants to say he's allergic to cats. So he really strongly protested. But he likes Molly way, way too much, and Molly likes cats way, way too much. And so <.> they were stuck taking the cat home and he was really unhappy, because he was thinking how allergic he was to cats, but he didn't know what that meant. And so they went home um happily ever after, I guess, with the cat. laughter I see. O K. O K? Do you have any pets back home? I have three dogs. Hm. I don't like cats. I don't like cats because dogs don't like cats. Oh. Interesting. O K. laughter Uh-huh. laughter If my dogs liked cats, I might think about liking cats. But they don't like cats. Though my dogs don't like dogs, but I don't really have a problem with the dogs. Just cats. Oh. I don't know. Something about cats. You know how they say dogs have their own personalities? Mh-hmm. How are the three dogs different? One is dumb. The other two aren't. laughter laughter Erm we have laughter our three dogs. And they're mane they're named Mine, Storm and Ours. Yes. Well we Mine got her name because my dad claimed that we had a possessive family, so he named the dog Mine. Hm. So whenever me and my brother'd be in the car and go, ""Where's Mine?"" he'd be like, ""At home."" laughter So laughter er Mine's really smart. And she used to be quite ornery, but now she jus she's she's getting a little old. She's I think she's about eight. She's a sweetie pie. sniff And then there's Stormy. Because my brother, he he was really into the weather. He watched the Weather Channel every day and ordered, all the videos. Do you know how many videos the Weather Channel has? Enough to fill up an entire bookshelf. Uh-huh. You don't want to see what all I mean they're, like, ""Watch how tornadoes blow down houses,"" and things like that. You know, it's weather. So he named the dog Storm. And so we have and Storm isn't so bright. Erm we to to explain this, we ha of our three dogs we er have a screen uu er we have a screen door and we have a main door in the back. And the dogs are hanging out in the back yard. And we're changing the screens. We use goes from glass in the winter, because it's cold, to a screen in the in the s mm for the spring and summer. And we're changing it out, so there's nothing. It's a door frame. So two smart dogs go through the door because, you know, it's air. It's just a door frame. And er Stormy, he er he sat outside and whined and had to be let in, because he didn't realize there was no glass in the door. laughter laughter I see. O K. But he's really sweet. Oh. And then there's Ours, which is Mine's puppy. And so because we had the dog named Mine, we'd figured the puppy should be Ours. Oh. More play on words. And she is ornery and she just like her mom used to be, and she fights with her mom all the time. All the time. And, yeah. But she she can be sweet. But she likes to bounce from person to person, because she has lots and lots of energy. Hm. You must miss all of them. A lot. Yeah. Yeah? Hmm. Well er we're finishing up with this interview. O K. Hm. Yeah. And um are you gonna watch more cartoons after you go back? Oh yeah. I'll never stop watching cartoons. laughter Yeah. Yeah. You have plans to watch them tonight? Mh-hmm. I have plans I always have plans to watch cartoons. I see. Let's see. Tonight is Thursday. Oh but I have class during the cartoon. So I'll just have to like watch something else. What what class is this? International business communication. And it the cartoon's always, here, are always from seven to eight. And so or sometimes beforehand. And so my class is from five-ten to six something. And I'll never get from the my class to home in time to watch cartoons. So Well. I'm sad. laughter Once in a while . ? Yeah. Once every Thursday. Ah. Because I'm silly and I have a class at nine-twenty to eleven in the morning. And then my next class is from five-ten to six-forty-five. . Why? I don't know. laughter Well enjoy the evening, whatever you do. All right. Thank you very much. And thanks again for coming here today. No problem. Hm.",0

May I have your name, please? My name is XXX02. XXX02. Yes. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. laughter laughter So um are you a student here? Yes, I am. Mh-hmm. What do you study? Erm I'm studying Japanese, mainly. Mh-hmm. Um I'm also taking arts and society, erm the history of Tokyo. And um every Wednesday, I have a field placement in an elementary school. Hmm. So every Tuesday, we have um social organization class to talk about things that happen every Wednesday. Hmm. I see. Can you tell me about that elementary school? Um it's a school that was built in ninety-ninety nineteen ninety-nine. Um there are about eight hundred students. Um the philosophy of the school is community, so they have three-wall-classrooms. Mh-hmm. So it can get very noisy laughter at times. Um I'm my my main purpose there is to help teach English. Mh-hmm. So just for correct pronunciations and clarification for the teachers and the students. So erm I usually eat lunch with the kids. Um I sometimes aid the teachers. And I just try to observe as much as I can while participating. Hmm. So do you like it there? I like it there. Yes. Hmm. It's definitely interesting because I wanna teach elementary school eventually. Uh-huh. So this is very good practice for me. Hm. I see. Um what are some difficulties that you face when you are there, if any? Hmm. sigh I think a lot of the difficulties uh are the cultural differences. Hm. Um because I know with Japanese schools, um a lot of times you just do what you are told and you don't really question the teacher. And I like to give kids choices. Hm. So sometimes when I give the kids choices, like what they wanna do, they look at me like, ""Is it O K if we can choose or you're just going to tell up what we're gonna do?"". Erm so and also the language is tough sometimes. Um I'm supposed to speak English to the children, but I try to speak Japanese during lunch with the teachers. Mh-hmm. And sometimes they look at me like they think I know what I'm talking about, but other times they don't. And I get frustrated because they don't understand. So but it goes both ways. Hm. I see. But I do have a lot of ideas that I want to take back to the States um when the students teach in the spring. Mh-hmm. O K. So so you came here to learn Japanese and to learn about Japan. Why are you interested? Um my grandma is Japanese. Oh. So it hasn't been a big part of my upbringing. But I've always wanted to learn more about it. Mh-hmm. Um and try to learn to speak the language. Mh-hmm. Um so that's the main reason why I chose Japan. I see. And I wanted somewhere different. Uh-huh. Because a lot of people from my school go to London and Paris and Madrid and I didn't wanna go to a main stream city so much. I see. Um so what's your grandma like? She's eighty-one. And she is the cutest person that I know of. laughter laughter Um she's just very funny and very lively. Mh-hmm. And she has so many stories from her upbringing. Hmm. And a lot of them are hard for her to talk about um because she hasn't been in Japan over thirty years. Hm. So um she's told me stories about the war when she was in Nagasaki when the bomb was dropped. And I don't wanna push her. Mh-hmm. But I also wanna know. So I can't really come right out and ask her Mh-hmm. um direct questions. Hmm. When you see her, what do you do together? Um <.> well she's always been there. So uh I mean in America. So um but when I see her, I just say, ""Hi hi, Grandma,"" and she's all ""Hi, Shay."". laughter So. Uh so you live together? Um she lives about twenty minutes away. Oh. But she's always been in I see. in my town. Uh-huh. So she's always been there. And where is your hometown? In XXX03, XXX04. Oh. O K. I've never been there. What's it like? laughter Um it's nice. It's a very industrial city. Um I think there's about a million people total. Hm. So it's a very communal place to live. There are a lot of different things to do. Um there's a lot of art galleries and museums and sports venues. Hm. Um so it's a very nice place to live and to visit. But I didn't wanna go to college there. I needed somewhere completely different. Mh-hmm. So I didn't wanna be at a big city and I didn't wanna be at a big school. So um er both of the main colleges in XXX03 are pretty big. Mh-hmm. So I chose to go elsewhere. I see. O K. Um all right. So we're going to move on. O K. O K? And I'll show you a picture. cough If you could describe what you see here. O K. Oh this looks like the side of a mountain. Erm probably a very touristy area. Um there is <.> probably a ski lodge. And there's two people having coffee talking, a male and a female. Um and outside, there is a snowman and skis and, oh what was that called, s a snowboard. laughter Um there's also people having a snowball fight. Um and one child is getting hit with the snowball. Um there are people skiing down the mountain, although it looks like they just skied off the top of the roof just by the way their position in the picture. Um there's one person who fell off <.> the skis. There's one person snowboarding. And it looks like, at the bottom right-hand corner, there's four people who are gonna talk about something, because it seems like they're coming together. Hm. O K. Um cough it snows a lot in XXX04 also. Yes. laughter Hm. Oh yes. It already has like there. Oh really? Yeah. laughter Um what do you usually do in the wintertime? Um sigh <.> I usually go sledding with my friends and my younger siblings. Erm sometimes we build snowmen. Um in January, we usually get about four and a half feet just in one month. So the snow never melts. So it's always there. So um we build igloos once in a while and go for hikes in the woods. Um <.> so I've I've gotten used to it. So right now in XXX05, it's not that cold for me. But I like snow and I miss it actually. Hmm. I see. O K. Um <.> hm. Can you tell me about something that you did with your sister um before you came to Japan? Mh-hmm. Did you spend time with her at all? Yeah. Yeah. Um well she's six. Hm. So before I left, I asked her what she wanted to do, because she wouldn't see me for four months. And she said that she wanted to dress up like me. laughter laughter So um I dressed her in some of my clothes and I did her hair and a little bit of makeup and some nail polish. Hmm. And um she wanted to go shopping together. So we went out for a little while. And my whole family had gone to see a movie. So um we're pretty close. Yeah. And when I look at her, I see her when I see myself Uh-huh. when she was my age. Oh. laughter So she's she's something else. laughter Hm. I see. O K. Now, the next picture. cough Once again, if you could describe what you see. This looks like part of a department store and is the electronic section. Erm there are a few T Vs for sale. Underneath that, there are some camcorders and cameras, possibly one is a digital camera. This is a salesman talking to a customer who looks like he's interested in buying a watch. And there are some C D players and stereos for sale. And it doesn't there are no other customers around. And it's three o'clock. Hm. O K. Erm have you shopped at department stores here? I haven't, actually. No? I've actually tried to stay away from department stores laughter and go toward smaller stores, more family owned Mh-hmm. stores. Why is that? Um I don't like big crowds. So that's why I sort of stay away from department stores. And smaller stores usually have more interesting things for sale. And they are more hand made and unique versus a main stream item. Hm. I see. What are some differences in shopping in Japan and in the States? One of the biggest things that I've noticed is in America, if you're in an aisle and if you're walking down the aisle and there's someone in your way, they usually move to get out of the way. laughter laughter Uh-huh. But in the Japanese stores, they just seem to stay in that one place and you sort of have to go around them even if there's someone else coming. Hmm. So there can sort of be one three people in one aisle and it can get a little congested and a little frustrating. Because even if you say, ""Excuse me,"" sometimes they still don't move. Hm. I'm not sure whether it's because I'm American or they just don't wanna move. Mh-hmm. laughter So that's the biggest difference that I've noticed. But the salespeople are very nice. Hm. And they sort of greet you when you come in. And say thank you <.> a lot. Right. laughter Yeah. A lot. Yeah. I see. Hm. O K. Thanks. Um now, we're going to do some role-plays. O K. O K? I'll give you a card. And if you could read it. And and let me know when you are ready. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? Mh-hmm. All right. May I help you? Yes. I'm looking for a one-bedroom apartment. O K. We have several. O K. Erm I would prefer the view to be looking overlooking a river of some sort. Um I would prefer it to not be near a subway line, so it's noisy. Erm and I also have a dog. So I'm wondering if you can help me find one er that allows pets to live there Mh-hmm. as well. Hm. Oh there are only a few places that allow pets now that I know of. O K. Um <.> do you know what the utilities are like? Or will it come uh the apartments come with furniture wise or? Well one is furnished. O K. O K? But it doesn't come with heat or water. You have to pay it separately. But the other one is the opposite. O K. Uh-huh. It's unfurnished but it's er O K. all the utilities are there. O K. Um do you know what the areas are like? Are they erm they have a lot of families or is it what age group the people usually tend to live in? Uh-huh. One is near a university, O K. so it's a young crowd. O K. And the other one is more for business people but it's mainly for single O K. people. Yeah. O K. Erm do you know if there's any families in the area uh areas or is it mainly college students and business people? Well there are houses around the apartment buildings. O K. O K. O K. So are you interested in seeing some of them I think I am. Er the two of them? Yes. O K. laughter So er I'll make an appointment. O K. O K? Thank you. All right. Thanks. So that's the end of this role-play. Hm. So um in the States, are you living alone? No, I live with my family. Oh. At at home. At home. Huh. Yes. I see. Um <.> how do you think it's different, living alone and living with family? My house at home is very busy. Erm there are six people in my family. So there's always something going on. Erm so I sort of gotten used to the hustle and bustle of everyday life and getting up early erm with my older brother and sister who are six and eight, and I have another brother who is sixteen. Hm. Oh. So erm I'm just used to ha hearing the six in the morning and them jumping in the bed with me and um just being able to cuddle with them on the couch and looking up to breakfast. Hmm. Erm but here, I live alone in a one-room apartment basically. So, you know, there's no one around, no one to wake up to, I always have to make breakfast. laughter So mm sometimes that could be a burden. But erm I sort of like being independent, so I think that I like living alone. But I also miss <.> the company at home. I sort of want both at the same time. Mh-hmm. But I can't have it. Hmm. laughter So but at home, you know, I have my own room and a sort of my space. And I ask my family that whenever the door is shut to please knock if they wanna come in. And that's just a general rule for the house basically. Hmm. I see. O K. Let's do next. Er let's try <.> er this one. O K? The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K. So it's a phone conversation. So ring-ring. Hello? This is XXX01. Hi, XXX01. It's XXX02. Hi, XXX02. How are you? Good. Um I'm wondering if you wanted to go out to the movies on Friday night, maybe. Friday night? Um sure. O K. Um there's a new movie coming out and I just wanted to go and check it out. Um was thinking um maybe the seven o'clock movie. Not too late, not too early. Mm. Actually, I'm working till seven. O K. Yeah. Erm do you wanna see a later show that night, or would you prefer that you go to a matinee on Saturday. Erm later that night is fine. O K. Yeah, yeah. Do you wanna say, around nine then, to give you enough time to clean up? laughter laughter Yeah, that sounds good. O K. Um do you want me to pick you up around eight-forty-five or so? Um if that's convenient for you. O K. Yeah. O K. O K. So I guess I'll see you Friday. O K. Great. Thanks for calling. Thanks. See you then. laughter See you. laughter That's the end of this one. All right. So what do you usually do with your friends here? sigh Well it's a lot harder to go out with people here because we all live so far apart. Oh. So always always have to take the train and meet at a station. And it takes so long to get to different places. Uh-huh. Erm I usually go out on the weekends. Erm just to different places in XXX05. Mh-hmm. Erm last weekend, I went to Asakusa all day. Hm. Erm and then Sunday, I went to the Meiji Temple. Erm but we usually just find little places to go to for day trips. And sometimes we take a long weekend. Erm but it's difficult because with the XXX06 schedule, we don't have a lot of free time. Mh-hmm. So but whenever we have time to go away, we do. Hm. I see. So but it's it's very different than the U. S. Hm. You know. Uh on my campus, the dorms are very close together, so you can just walk for two minutes and go see your friend. But here, you've to get in the train for twenty minutes sometimes and then you get to see your friends. So. Hm. I see. So what did you do in Asakusa? Um we went shopping. Ah. Erm and it was my second time there. So I was pretty familiar with the area. But erm the last time we went, erm it was just for a tour of the temple, actually. Um sort of behind the scenes and not a lot of people get to do. Hm. So we went into the gardens and into the pagoda and underneath the museums and stuff. Hm. Hm. So it was it was very exciting actually. And erm I felt privileged to be able to do that. Mh-hmm. Erm but this time, we just walked around the outside and sort of observed all the people. And I got a chance to see the flow of people and how how they shop, you know, Mh-hmm. if they walk the street down in the middle or if they walk on one side and switch. Erm and I went to lunch with my friend. So that was nice. It's a nice day. Sure. laughter Sounds fun. O K. One last role-play. Oops. This one. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? May I help you, ma'am? Yes. Erm I'm thinking about taking a vacation Mh-hmm. um somewhere warm, tropical, maybe. Erm I'm not really sure. Erm are there any places that you might suggest? How about Singapore or Indonesia? O K. Yeah. Erm do you know, once I get there, how easy it is to get around the area to both of those places? I haven't I don't know much about either. Uh-huh. Well erm a lot of people in Singapore speak English, so I don't think you'll have any troubles there, O K. get around. Um Indonesia, you might need a a tour guide. O K. Erm in Singapore, what's the main mode of transportation? Er car. A car? Yeah. O K. Erm. Hm. Well they have the subway, too. O K. Erm are there any main <.> attractions that you think I should see in Singapore? I'm not I'm not um familiar with the area. So um are there any cities that I should see er or places I should visit? Well it's a nice mixture of mixture of, you know, the city life and a lot of um botanical gardens. Mm-hm. O K. Hm. So. The areas around the botanical gardens, do they have hotels? Um yes, a few. O K. Erm do you think you might be able to help me um book a flight and a hotel in one of those Of course. areas? Sure. So I'll put a package together for you. O K. O K. Great. And I'll call you when it's ready. O K. All right. Thank you. That's the end of the the role-play. O K. So um <.> where have you traveled recently? laughter laughter Erm I think it was about almost a month ago actually. Um XXX06 took a trip to Kyushu. Hmm. Um and we flew into Fukuoka Airport and drove to Kumamoto. And then continued on to Uemura and we stayed there for six days. Erm each of us stayed with a host family. Er I visited an elementary school while I was there. And we went rafting down the Kuma Gawa. Er my host family took me to Mount Aso. And I really, really liked the area. Um quite different from XXX05. But it was nice to get away for a few days. Mh-hmm. Erm and then two weeks ago, I flew back down to Kyushu to see my aunt in XXX06. Oh. Erm I haven't seen her in seventeen and a half years, laughter so it was quite a reunion and it was a very very nice visit. Hmm. And and she was just very, very warm to me and I felt like no time had passed. And you know, I didn't remember too much about her because I was three Hm. the last time I saw her. But erm and we went to Sasebo one day and just went around the area. And so that's laughter the last big trip that I took. Oh. Erm so it was a very good trip. Hm. I see. And how did you keep in touch with her all these years? Erm it was very difficult to. Erm because erm she hasn't seen my grandma Hm. in seventeen and a half years either. Hm. Um and it's very, very hard for them to see each other or talk to each other because they're so far away. Mh-hmm. And now, my grandma is too old to fly to Japan. And my aunt isn't able to fly to America. So the distance is really taking a toll on them. Erm but I think every few months, my aunt sends a package to my grandma with magazines and a letter and food. And my grandma writes letters to her. So the relations have basically been through my grandma. Mh-hmm. Erm so it meant a lot to my whole family about me being able to go visit her. Hm. Hm. I'm glad you did. laughter laughter O K. Yeah. It's the last task here. Hm. I'll show you some pictures and I want you to make up a story. O K. cough Excuse me. <.> O K? So the pictures go this way. And this happened before. So if you can start the story with, ""One day last week"". One day last week, erm John and Maria were walking down the street when it was raining. And they both had their umbrellas up. And they heard a noise coming from a box on the side of the street. And John recognized it first and told Maria about it. So Maria bent down erm and opened the box. And there was a kitten in there. So she picked up the kitten. And she asked John if she could take it home. And he said, ""No. You know, I really don't want you to take it home."". And Maria said, ""Please. It would mean a lot to me. "" And then John said, ""Well I'm not quite sure."". He said, ""But I guess it would be O K."". So erm John held his umbrella over Maria and the kitten. And they continued home. O K. Erm <.> when you have a disagreement with someone, Mh-hmm how do you usually resolve it? I usually <.> take sometime for myself first erm to think about everything and what I wanna say, erm I bite my tong. Hm. I don't wanna say something that I'm gonna regret later. Hm. So I usually go in my room and listen to some music to clear my head a little bit. And then we usually talk about it later. Erm we usually don't sit down and say, ""O K, we're going to erm clear this whole situation up."". But it sort of comes up in conversation and we resolve it then. So in conversation we say, ""You know oh you know, I wanna talk to you about that."". Yeah. Erm it just sort of fits into the context of the conversation. Hm. I see. Hm. O K. Next, lastly, laughter laughter O K. Again, there are six pictures. If you could make a story. cough The interviewee is looking at the pictures. O K. One day last week, erm Jerry had come home from college. And his dad decided to take him out to dinner. So his dad asked him which restaurant he wanted to go to. So Jerry pointed to one restaurant and so his dad said, ""O K."". So they went in. And he told the waiter erm all about Jerry coming home from college and he was just very excited. He wanted him to be uh he wanted it to be a special night. So the two of them sat down. And the waitress came over. And they ordered, looks like, fried chicken and fish. And they Jerry had a beer and his dad ordered a glass of wine. And then they decided they got full. So his dad paid the bill. And they left er ra the restaurant. And Jerry had another obligation that night. So he said thank you to his dad and left to enjoy the rest of the events for the night. Hm. O K. Um could you tell me about a good restaurant that you go to in XXX05 or in Japan? Hm. <.> I usually don't go out that much Hm. to eat. Erm just because I try to save a little bit of money. Mh-hmm. Erm I usually eat lunch at XXX07 in one of the cafeterias. Mh-hmm. Erm because that's where all my friends are. Erm so we usually call each other and say, ""Where are you eating lunch?"" Hm. And so we'll have lunch together. And sometimes it's just two of us, sometimes it's a big group. So erm at least I enjoy socializing with my friends and seeing them everyday. Mh-hmm. laughter laughter How do you like Japanese food? I love it. Mh-hmm. I love it. My grandma's cooked it a lot Hm. um as I've grown up. So I've gotten used to the taste. Sure. Erm and I think my favorite thing hm laughter I'm not a huge fan of sushi, but I do like wakame udon. laughter Uh-huh. So that's one of my favorite things here. Right. And there're also I'm not sure what they are called exactly, but I know they are pickles, the yellow, some kind of vegetable. U-huh. I like that with rice. laughter I see. Yeah. Hm. So if you don't go out that much, you must cook. I do. Uh-huh. What's er your Erm. a good recipe that you often make? I usually make rice with shumai laughter and miso soup. Uh-huh. I'm trying to stay away from American food while I'm here. Ah. Erm I don't go to McDonald's, I don't go to Wendy's. Erm I want to. But I can get that at home. So I figured while I can, I get the unique Japanese taste. And a lot of my friends, you know, they say, ""I can't believe you have to cook for yourself every night."". And I say, ""Well I don't mind."" Mh-hmm. So I like it a lot. And I like cooking and experimenting. Not too much laughter but enough. laughter Uh-huh. So you make shumai from scratch? No. I buy that laughter I buy that from the store. laughter I see. But everything else, I try to do it myself. Just so that I can learn. And, you know, when I go home, I can cook with my grandma now. Ah. That's right. And erm so since she hasn't been here for so long, maybe I can teach her some new things and she can teach me some old things. So that would be nice. Hm. I see. O K. So um what else do you want to do in the rest of the time while you are here? I wanna travel as much as I can. Erm I have a lot of work coming up but that's second on my list. Erm at home, normally it'd be number one. But I'm in Japan. laughter So I'm planning to go to Kyoto next weekend. Hmm. And and then XXX06 is going to British Hills in Nikko at the end of the month, Thanksgiving. And then, I think, the third week in December, a few friends and I are going to Hiroshima. So that'll be an exciting trip because we have finals the next week. Ah. So we just wanna get away before finals and then pack and get ready to go back to America. Hm. O K. So your trip to Kyoto, how are you going to arrange that? Erm well because we're kind of students, we were able to apply for a twenty-percent discount. Hm. So erm we have the discount tickets. Mh-hmm. So we just have to go erm buy the shinkansen tickets. And we have to book a hostel on line. So there's a lot of work involved but it's definitely worth it in the end. Sure. It must be beautiful now. laughter Yeah. laughter I can't wait to see it. Right. O K. So we're wrapping up. laughter O K. Um do you have a busy schedule tonight? Tonight, I do. Oh. Yes. Erm I have some friends coming over tomorrow evening. So I have to clean laughter and go grocery shopping. Hm. Erm so I there's a time limit as to when they can stay, so I have to, you know, take them home pretty early. Cook dinner, socialize for a while and then erm walk them back to the train station. Plus, I have a quiz tomorrow. And a mid-term on Monday. So Hm. pretty hectic. But I think these next two trips coming up or three trips, actually, will be a nice reward. Hm. So are you going to heat up some shumai for them? laughter laughter I'm actually gonna make fried rice Oh really? for them. Yeah. Hm. O K. So Sounds very good. laughter I'm excited about having people over. Sure. Sure. O K. So I hope you have a great time. Thank you. O K. And thank you very much for coming today. Oh you're welcome. laughter O K.",0

Ur I'm just studying abroad for four months, basically studying Japanese language and the culture. O K. Um what do you find interesting about Urm. the language? Oh just because it was ur just so different from uh English, like with the kanji characters and just language structure. And I'd actually taken ur French and Spanish in high school. Mh-hmm.

Urm they aid different like works with um like movements against discrimination. Like in Japan and also all over the world, erm a lot of staff that deals with mi migrant workers like they're going to other countries, and discriminated against and treated badly. Hm. So I like it. It's very interesting. Hm. O K. So in the States, urm what do you study? International studies. Uh-huh. Mh-hmm. And what does that mean? Urm basically just how different countries interact with one another. And kind of urm how like one country's actions effect other countries and stuff like that. Mm. And my minor is, actually doing a double minor in history and women's studies. So I kind of I think all kind of go together laughter a little bit. Right. O K. Urm what are your plans for after graduation? Urm I'm not quite sure. I might go to grad school or urm I might work in an N G O. I kind of chose to do one here because I thought I might like that kind of informational experience to seek something I like, or travel. laughter But I think I'd probably have to like make more money before I go travel. laughter I see. Mm. So, so far, what do you like about Japan? Urm everyone's really nice. They are a lot nicer than they are in the States. And urm just kind of like getting used to the whole different experience and everything. Um just the whole atmosphere is completely different. And I really like that a lot. And learning the language's really neat, interesting. So I like that. Um can you tell me about a Japanese friend that tut Urm. you've met like so far? We had ur E-pals before we came that wrote to us at home. And um mine's just been really nice. She almost of the E-pals were here like the first week we came, and mine was here everyday. And urm it's made you a lot more comfortable. And except she's really nice. We gone to karaoke laughter which I've liked a lot. And she work she actually works at Disneyland on the weekends, and waitresses during the week. So she's really busy, but urm she went to ur Disneyland with us because of us went. And that was really fun, Hm. I think she's come to I live in a dorm and she's come there a couple of times to see a . Mm. What's fun about karaoke? Urm just watching different people and how they sing and kind of get really into singing the songs. Mm-hm. That's what I like to do. laughter I like to watch it when they sing. Hm. After a while, I get comfortable and sing. But Uh-huh. watching, yeah, people's facial expressions and how they sing. laughter I like that. laughter laughter Yeah. . O K. Um now, I'm going to show you a picture. O K. Hm. If you can describe what you see. O K. Urm I see a man who looks to me pointing at watches in in a electrical store, and a store clerk kind of showing him where to go and what to look at. Urm there's a bunch of different kind of electrical appliances. Like ur regular cameras, video c recorders, television, stereo equipment, and a large entertainment unit, telephones. And it's three o'clock. Urm <.> But I the customer looks a little confused. Urm and there's also a fax machine. And the employee the employee just looks very happy to see him there. sigh That's about it. laughter Mm. O K. O K. <.> Mm. So you said you live in a dorm. Yes. O K. So you probably didn't have to buy these No. laughter appliances. Mm-um. Mm. Kind of all there. Mm-hm. What is it like, your dorm room? Ur it's actually I a lot larger than I thought it would be. Because everyone, before I come to Japan, said it would probably be really small. Urm but it's actually probably the same size or bigger than the ones at my university at home. And actually I've like a cabinet and a chest of drawers, and shelves, my bed and the desk and sink and the mirror. Er the sink and the mirror are next to one another. Mm. Mm. And I like it. Actually, it's a lot bigger than I thought, and comfortable. laughter Yeah. Have you had any problems while you are at the dorm? Urm right now, my heat. It is kind of a problem because I think the remote control on the ur heat and air conditioning unit is broken, like I tried changing the batteries, and it doesn't work. Um so I can't get the heat to turn on. That's starting to get pretty cold. laughter Ah. But other than that, I haven't had any problems. I have to ask my dorm manager about that this evening. Uh O K. Mm. All right. Hm. So next, another picture. O K. The interviewer is taking out a picture. Just describe what I see? Mm-hm. Urm it looks like a ski lodge, because of all the skiers and the ski lifts, in winter. And it looks like the children are having a snowball fight. And someone made a snowman right in front of the snow pail. So looks like it's about to be s fall down. Urm and it also looks to be a lot of different issues going out with the skiers. One is falling has fallen over and has his ski off, and his ski pole has gone flying. And another one looks like she's going in a the wrong direction. She's going to hit two other skiers. And none of them have their goggles on. I don't know much about skiing, but I thought you're supposed to wear goggles to protect your eyes, except for the guy who's falling down, he's goggles on. And there's a snowboarder in a background who looks like he's going to hit the man who fall down fell down. And there're two people in the cabin having coffee or hot chocolate to keep nice and warm in the cold. And there's a director guy who looks like he's trying to tell the girl that she's going the wrong way. But she doesn't look like she's paying much attention. Mm. O K. laughter So you're from XXX03. Yes. Do you like the weather there? Urm sometimes. laughter laughter Uh-huh. Uh it can get really, really windy and cold in the winter. Uh-huh. And that 's all feels a lot colder because of the wind, and it really is. And I say I don't like driving in the weather like that. Mhm. But ur like fall and spring, it's actually really beautiful there. And I like those seasons a lot better than winter or summer because summer can get pretty humid. Not as humid as it is in here. laughter But fairly humid. Mm-hm. So how do you spend your time in the winter then? Urm sometimes we all go out in snow, and like build snowmen and then snowball fights. It's pretty flat in XXX04 so we can't go skiing, and I've never been skiing. But other times we'll just, you know, do indoor activities or go to the movies or go shopping and try to keep warm. laughter <.> O K. Urm now, we're going to do some role-plays. O K. Hm. <..> If you could read this card. Let me know when you're ready. The interviewee is reading the card. Mm-hm. O K. May I help you, ma'am? Urm yes. I'd like to purchase a camera. O K. We have lots. O K. Do you have anything any urm digital cameras? Oh sure. Urm ur how much do they cost usually? Well they range from mm ten thousand yen to hundred thousand yen. laughter O K. Urm do you have any ur Sony cameras? Of course. O K. Ur can I see one? Sure. Well actually, we have three kinds. O K. Ur which is the best one? laughter Ur this one. O K. And how much does this one cost? This one is about sixty thousand yen. Does it take good digital pictures? Oh of course. So I can upload them on my computer without any trouble, and all my friends come look at it? Right. O K. Urm let's see, I'm not sure. Urm I'd like to get this one Yeah? purchase this one. Mm-hm. O K.

I'll get one. laughter Yeah? Uh urm a lot of people here have them, and they seem really convenient. Except urm I do like having like photos that pronoun like the hard photos Uh-huh. which you don't usually get good quality ones with the digital cameras. Right. So So I'd have one. how how is it different, the quality of the pictures? Urm well you can put them on the computer and print them out. But they look like kin kind of fuzzy, the ones I've seen because my sister actually has one, and it's you can tell it's a digital photo instead of another one. But you can get urm when we were in Kyu we were in Kyushu in October, and the the host family I stayed with had a digital one, and they have really good digital cameras. But you have to buy like a little photo center to get really good pictures like that. So I think that's the only drawback. That and they're very expensive laughter Hm. as opposed to normal cameras. Mhm. O K. So um have you gone ur shopping at a store like the one in the picture? No. Ur well. Electrical store? Urm I got a camera actually before I came here. It's not digital though. Just because I wanted to have the urm actual copy of the photos. Urm and I got one at a store at home, and just went looking around at different things, and got a small cute one that I liked. Mm. But it's not digital. No. O K. I see. O K. Next one, mm O K, this one. if you could read it. And let me know when you're ready. O K. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? Mm-hm. Hi. Hi.

Can I bring all my luggage aboard, or is there any luggage restriction? Oh no, no, no. No. O K. I'll take the super-express then, to New York. O K. So just one ticket? Yes. Just one. One way? Yes. O K. Here you are. Thank you. O K. What time does it leave? Urm actually, you need to rush. In five minutes. O K. laughter laughter Thank you. O K. Thank you very much. Uh. The end of the role-play. laughter Urm you've been to New York? Er it was a long time ago. Like I was urm like ten or twelve. Uh-huh. Can you tell me about that trip? Urm we were actually visiting friends of ours who lived in Florida whose grandparents lived in New York. So we went to New York to see them. Urm we were actually only in the city for a couple of hours that day, and I know we saw the Twin Towers when we were there. Now that I think about it, I remember that. Hm. Urm and we saw the Empire State Building from the car. But our parents were really concerned that it was very dangerous so we had to stay in the car at all times. laughter Because they were afraid that something's gonna happen. Urm that was pretty much it from New York that I remember. I'd like to go back though, and go see plays on Broadway and stuff like that. And we were outside New York, urm like in a suburb, we went ur a lake nearby, and it was actually very beautiful. There weren't a lot people there. And there was um a waterfall. It was really small that we went to, you know, it was like uh upstate New York. It was fun. You mentioned Broadway. Mm. What do you like about musical? Urm I just like the performance and this most of the songs. Urm I'm not like uh that familiar with musicals, but just to go and see some, I think. Because I hear a lot of different songs. But the one my er mother likes some different musicals. So I hear some music. So I'd like to go just to see them. Mhm. My aunt and uncle actually go to New York a lot to see plays on Broadway. Hm. And they always come back with good stories. Hm. laughter O K. O K. So one more role-play. cough O K. This one. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. It's a phone conversation. Mm-hm. So I'll start. O K. Ring-ring. Hello, this is XXX01. Hi, it's XXX02. Hi, XXX02. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Urm do you have any plans for tomorrow evening? Ur not really. Do you wanna go see a movie? O K. Did you have any preference to any kind of movie or anything? Urr nothing scary. Nothing scary? O K. Urm let's see. Do you wanna go see the new Harry Potter movie? laughter Yeah. Urm yeah, O K. O K. Urm let me check. I think the time is seven o'clock. Is that O K? Yeah. Perfect. O K. Urm do you wanna meet at the movie theater or at the train station or <.> drive or? laughter O K. How about that new cafe ur in front of the station? In front of the station? Yeah. O K. Which station? laughter laughter Shinjuku. Shinjuku. O K. Uh-huh. Do you know what the name of the cafe is? Urr. Is it the Starbucks? laughter No, but ur you'll you'll. No, it's not Starbucks actually. But you'll find it. It's. Right outside the station? Yeah. O K. Do you wanna like meet there beforehand before we see the movie just to have a cup of coffee and go? Obviously. laughter For coffee. laughter Yeah. O K. O K. Urm like at six-thirty? Is it O K? Sure. Yeah. O K. Then I'll see you tomorrow night at six-thirty. O K. Looking forward to it. O K. O K. Bye. Thanks for calling. Bye. Bye. laughter laughter End of that role-play. Hm. O K. Urm so what do you do when you go out with your friends here? Urm I've done a lot of karaoke. laughter Well other than that. Yeah, other than that. Urm we've gone we just have gone to a lot of different cities to see them and gone gone shopping. We went to Asakusa Asakusa last Saturday. Mh-hmm. I went shopping a lot. Urm And just go see like the basically different sightseeing all around Japan just to take in everything. So. Hm. How about when you were in the States? Ur in the States, we go shopping laughter laughter a lot. O K. Urm go out to dinner, go to movies or like ur parties on college campuses Hm. and stuff. So um <.> hm how do you compare uh shopping in the States and here? Urm the c well when we were in Shibuya, the clothes here were a little more more wild. laughter laughter And the shoes are really high. And probably more expensive than they are in the States. Um and they don't have all the things that is interesting is like the malls, the shopping centers and malls in America, they are really like spread out and usually about two floors. But here, everything was up which I thought was interesting, it's because of like the space and everything. That was interesting. Yeah. A lot more crowded. laughter Mm. I see. Mhm. O K. Now, ur I'm going to show you some pictures. O K. Mmm. Let's see. The interviewer is selecting a card. Since you like to go shopping, laughter let's do this one. O K. Urm so the pictures go this way. Mh-hmm. O K? You can use ur all of them to make up a story, and this happened before. O K. So please start with ""One day last week"". O K. Um one day last week, a woman went into a department store to go shopping for a birthday present for her husband. Erm and she was looking at the tie rack, and purchased a green and yellow tie from the man at the store as a birthday gift. She then noticed the shoes on sale, and no one could really blame her because those shoes. And looked at those, and decided that she'd go shopping for herself where she purchased clothing on her fifty percent off. That's a pretty good deal. And left the store with more gifts for herself than for her husband. laughter Uh-huh. O K. laughter Urm laughter what do you do when you find something that you just can't resist buying, but you know you shouldn't be spending that much money? Urm I usually think it over a little bit, and then try to talk myself until I need it. laughter laughter I sort of ""Oh."". I can usually try and justify it depending on the price. If it's too high urm too high of a price, usually I'd have to bet, I probably wouldn't think I need it. But if it's somewhat reasonable, I'd talk myself into getting it most of the time. Uh-huh. Mm. And if it's on sale, it's always better. Uhh. laughter I see. Mm. And you mentioned this was a birthday gift. Urm if you remember, can you tell me how you spent your last birthday? Urm <.> I think I was at school as today we've classes at school. Mh-hmm. And so in the evening, my friends took me out for dinner and desserts and at a restaurant. And urm my parents sent me flowers. I got a lot of cards. Urm and we went out for des dinner and dessert, and had gifts and everything. And it's during the weekdays so we'd class the next day, and did our homework afterward. laughter laughter So that wasn't fun, but that was a good day. Just going out for dinner and stuff like that. Because I was at school. Sure. O K. Now, lastly, mm speaking of dinner, Yeah. once again, if you could make up a story and start with ""One day last week"". O K. The interviewee is looking at the pictures. Ur one day last week, a man and his son decided to go out for dinner to it looks to be an expensive restaurant. And just sat down and had their order taken a good meal with fish and chicken. Urm and discussed many different things about both their lives. Urm and just basically had a nice little dinner, and they were both very hungry, and went separate ways when they were done eating. And that's about it. laughter Mm-hm. O K. Could you tell me about the best restaurant you've ever been to? Urm best restaurant I've ever been to. Urm oh-oh ur gone to a lot of different restaurants. I like different things from different restaurants. Mm. Urm. If you have to choose one. Choose one. I really like the Cheese Cake Factory at home. It's a chain of restaurants in the States. And they just have um a wide variety Uh-huh. on their menu. So if you like Italian, you eat Italian. Or if you like fish, you'd have fish. Or burgers, burgers. So it's probably pretty good for everyone. And then they have really good desserts. laughter I don't really like cheesecake, but they have really good cheesecake. Urm actually, my friend, my mother, and myself, before I came to Japan, all went out for lunch there. And my friend, for dessert ordered strawberry short cake, and it was probably bigger than her meal. laughter And she well she's really tiny, and my mother and I was surprised. She finished about three-quarter of it. We were impressed laughter because it was so big. But er they have a good menu. If you're ever in the States, I'd go find one. Mhm. O K. Mh-hmm. Um when you go out to dinner in the crowd, how do you decide where to go? Urm a lot of my friends, we all kind of have the same tastes so that kind of helps. Urm and usually, if not, then majority rules. It's if someone really hates the restaurant, I doubt we'll go. But urm since we can't share the same taste, it's a little easier if someone oh have a taste for something, we'll go there. Or um at at my school, the Monier has kind of has like a food court so anyone can get any kind of food they like. So that kind of solves any disagreements. But when we decide to go to a restaurant, we pretty much all like the same things so that kind of makes it easier. Mm. And if not, you can always find something that good somewhat like Hm. most of the time. I see.Mm. Do you have any trouble here with the food? Urm I thought I would have more trouble, but I've tried a lot of things that um <.> I wouldn't have tried in the States. I eat now a lot more fish here than I've ever had in my life. laughter And I think it's because they ha urm here it is at least to me it seems there's more variety of fish because I don't like what they have at home. laughter So I've kind of felt I thought would ur kind of freak me out before I came. I did. But it's actually but O K. I just um I kind of miss fruits and vegetables a bit more because they are ur like at school or at home, I always have melon. Just because I'm like living in the dorm here that it doesn't we get one meal for dinner, and then my university in the United States, they've a lot like a large selection of food so we don't get as many fruits and vegetables. But I do buy them on occasion Mh-hmm. Hm. and eat them. Hm. O K. Well ur we're finishing up this interview. O K. laughter laughter Um do you have any plans for the weekend? Urm yes. laughter We are doing a community service project on Saturday. Urm at the bay, I think. And then my friend is coming to my dorm, and we're probably gonna watch a D V D laughter that she hasn't seen. Mm-hm. Or she has seen, I haven't seen. Um actually tomorrow night, I'm going to a friend's house, and we're gonna with some of her e-pals or Japanese friends and then we'll have smoores. laughter Smoores? Smoores. Oh really? Mm-hm. Because I don't think they knew what smoores are. Uh-huh. Where are you going to make them? At um she in her dormitory, they have ur she has a kitchen and a stove and everything. So I think well over her stove, we're making them, but I'm not too sure. We'll find out tomorrow. And then Sunday, I have a lot of homework, tut I think. And also do something else laughter laughter which might happen. laughter Right. Mm-hm. I hope you have a great time with your friends Thank you. laughter tomorrow. O K. And thanks for coming in. O K? Yeah. laughter O K.",0

Can I have your name, please? Name is XXX02. XXX02? Yes. Is that O K, XXX02? That's fine. O K. How are you today, XXX02? I'm very fine, thank you. O K. You look fine. Right. You're not cold? No. That's actually really not that cold today. O K. So. You have a good lunch? Yeah. Not bad. Ate with my friends and it was delicious. Ar around here, in the cafeteria, or? Yes, in the cafeteria at XXX03. And it was delicious? It was very good. laughter What was it, may I ask? Uh I had curry and rice. And that was delicious. It was very good. Surprisingly so. O K. O K. Are you living around here, XXX02? Um I live in XXX04 City. Urm that's Oh O K. pretty it's about forty minutes from here. O K. Yeah. In a dormitory in XXX05. I see. Several of the other students live there, I think. Yes. In the same place. Yeah. Yeah. A couple of guys and a couple of girls from different . Right. Right. How i how is it living there? It's pretty nice actually. It's a lot of freedom, and they serve us meals every now and then. Single room so it's not bad at all. Where're you where're you from originally? I'm originally from XXX06. So I I have a lot of XXX07 given to me. Ahh. O K. Well I'm not gonna make any. O K. That's O K. So that's a relief. laughter O K. Ur um what what do you do here? Urm I study Japanese at XXX03, and that's I'm taking an arts and society course, so studying the language and the society. O K. Tell me about that society course. Urm it's an arts and societies class. And we're reading ""The Tale of Genji"" right now. And we just finished up with part of that. And we're moving to the medi medieval art in Japan. And we're reading No plays. And we have our mid-term on Friday. So ur I gotta study for that. O K. How how did you end up in this program if I may ask? Ur well I was actually here last summer for six weeks because after my freshman year of college, I didn't have anything to do that summer. So I decided to take a summer abroad, and I stayed here for six weeks. And then I liked it so much that I came back for a semester. And that's so I'm trying to make it my minor. Japanese is my minor now. Hm. Hm. So. How can you do that? Urm well my in my major, I have to have a certain amount of credits in something not computer science. So I decided to take Japanese, you know, takes it away. So after this semester, I have to fill the requirement in Japanese language. Back in the States? Mm-hm. Back at my college. And in the time being, how are you making the most of your time here to acquire Japanese? Urm well I take an hour and a half of Japanese four days a week, and every Thursday, I have a kanji test or a kanji class and then test. So I'm writing I'm learning how to write and to speak, too. And I try to hang out with Japanese people as much as possible, and speak really bad Japanese because I'm just starting pretty much. It's pretty fast. So. Oh tell me about the last time you hang hung out with Japanese? Well I actually ate ur lunch with two Japa two of my Japanese friends. Ah. And it's pretty much a mix of the few words I know in Japanese and English English because they all speak really perfect English. So it's again interesting. What do you think ur i is ur perhaps a more productive way to to acquire Japanese? Urm I've living in Japan is a pretty good way to do it. And just it takes a lot of personal effort. Like I find myself speaking more English, and then I say, ""I should be speaking more Japanese."". And so I try, and it's kind of tough, but once you practice for a while, it's easier. So I I just have to make a conscious effort actually speaking instead of just language so and so. I I think coming to Japan and taking classes at Japanese university is a really good way. Because and you learn you learn a lot more kanji that way because you see it every day on the train. So it it helps. You learn a lot of new words, because you're walking down the street willing to learn. What do you do on the weekends? Urm weekends, we actually Saturday night, we went to an all-night karaoke place, laughter and sang karaoke and drank all night. So that's it could be interesting. And sometimes we go into Tokyo, and we go dancing and clubbing or something, so it can get pretty interesting. I'm a bit old for clubbing. Tell me about the la the last club you went to. Oh the last club. I think I think it was on my birthday in September when we went clubbing last. And we went clubbing in Xanadu in Shibuya. Ur all my yeah, that was it was pretty fun. My friend my Japanese friends and some of my American friends. And we danced all night. It was interesting. What what's it like? I mean ur Urm. haven't been to a disco in twenty years. laughter Ur it's crowded, and there are a lot of people dancing. I don't know, it's dark. Urm you know, it's something to experience, really, you know. O K. O K. Well I've got er some things to do with you today. First of all, I'd like to show you this picture here. O K. I'd like you to describe this in detail for me, XXX02. O K. Well it's a classroom. And there are a few six students and one teacher. She tea she seems to be teaching math of some sort, maybe trigonometry. And she is uh astutely teaching, but none of the students are really paying well one student is paying attention and taking notes while another girl is playing with her er cell phone. One boy in front is blowing bubble gum and looking out the window. And two girls in the back are talking and putting on makeup. And another student is drinking, and has his headphones on so I doubt he is paying very close attention either. And it seems to be a very pretty out day outside so I guess that's why he's looking out. O K. Could you compare the scene of this classroom to the scene of your own high school back in the States? My high school. Mhm. In my trigonometry class, it was somewhat similar. Urm the teacher would rattle on about trigonometry, and sev some people would be taking notes, some people would be staring out the window and not paying attention. And of course, there would always be the high school girls talking in the back, not paying any attention at all. laughter So uh kind of kind of similar. How did the teacher try to control those girls at the back? Ohh sometimes, she would yell at them or call their names and say, ""Play pay attention, please."". And other days, it seemed she was just so tired she just would just keep teaching and not really pay any attention to them. So I don't know, it takes a lot of stamina to teach high school kids, I guess. laughter Yeah. What was your fondest memory from high school? Fondest memory from high school. Hm. It was probably when, in my senior year, my two best friends and I went to our senior awards night uh in the town thir like thirty-minute car drive from my hometown. And we went, and we got our awards, and watched the senior video, which was like old memories from high school and things. And then we went out to eat. And we had a pretty good time, and then we drove home. It was it was pretty it wasn't really exciting, though. I don't know why it's my bes my favorite memory though. It was just the one of the last times I got to hang out with my two best friends from high school. So it was it was a pretty good night. Yeah. I can imagine. laughter I can imagine. I'm sure. Not really exciting, but. Memorable, though. Yeah. Memorable. That's right. O K. And I'd like to show you ur another thing. I'd like to show you ur this picture here. And there's a map. I'd like you to s tell me what you see or describe this town. laughter Urm well it's a map of a town that isn't labeled. Urm there's a train station. And in front of the train station, Route twenty-four runs past. There's a river to the north called the North River. And south of that is Riverside Park. There's a zoo, a bank, various offices. There is a school. Across from the school is a public library. And there's a hospital. And across Station Way, there's a restaurant. And then across the street from that is Elm Street and the Parkview Apartments. And across the road from Park Avenue is the supermarket which is near the bookstore, near the post office. And Route four-four-four runs in front of the post office. There are movie theaters. There is the South River. And near Shady Lane Road, there're various houses. And in the whole map, there're one, two, three, four, five, six bus stops. O K. What what sort of impression do you get from this place? Mhm. Ur I assume many te people take the bus. laughter Because there're many bus stops. And there is a bus station and a train station so I assume it's a lot like Tokyo where people don't have cars, and they take the bus or the train, and walk places. It seems pretty well rounded. There's movie theaters, supermarket, hospital, post office, schools. So I think you could live here in the houses and par or the apartments and pretty much have anything you wanted. There's a park and a river so it's a quaint little place to live, I assume. O K. Now, I know you live you're you're originally from XXX06. Ur where in XXX06, may I ask? Ur I'm from XXX08 which is a XXX08. tiny town between XXX09 and XXX10. O K. Not being amazingly familiar with that area, I don't know, maybe you will. laughter could you tell could you compare XXX09 laughter with this kind of er place? Urm well in my hometown, things aren't really spaced together like this. There's urm there would be a lot of apartments, and then you would have to drive down the road maybe ten minutes, and then there would be a grocery s a supermarket, and then drive down the road a few more minutes to the post office. And it's pretty spaced out. If you don't have a car, you really can't get around anywhere. And there are no buses and no trains. And urm and it's pretty rural. There're a lot of ur like I live on a farm, and that's about ten minutes out of town so to get to a lot of the houses, you have to drive out of town. Hm hm hm. And go out to the sticks of XXX06 and so it's it's not as convenient as this, I would imagine. There are no buses at all? Mm none that I know of. So if you don't have a car, what do you do? Um you walk or you find a friend that has a car. So without a car, it's you're pretty much out of luck. Eh. Or or you have to live in the apartments that are semi-close to everything, and just walk. Mhm. So I don't know, it's pretty tough without a car. Mhm. sniff O K. You where do you go to college in the States? Urm I go to college in XXX11 which is in XXX12. O K. I'm getting my geography. To the south. South. Yeah. O K. In the XXX13. Yeah. Yeah. Have you found any great differences between where Urm. where you grew up and where you are now? I realize that my home town in XXX06 in general is much prettier than XXX12. Hm. Hm hm hm. Like there're rolling hills and trees and seasons. And in XXX12, it's flat and ugly and it's summer pretty much ten months out of the year. And then we have a really brutal two months of winter, and then summer again. So a lot of and the towns are pretty similar. There's except my college town, it's pretty close together because to make it convenient people walk from their apartments to the college. But urm and getting around isn't that hard. You can pretty much walk. And ur but the college town is really small. And my college has about twenty thousand students. And the town itself was built for maybe when it was about five thousand students. So especially in the fall, when all the new students are around, the traffic is just awful because there're narrow streets, and short distances between stops. And so it's just traffic is a nightmare. So. Being that the overall impression is not too positive, laughter can I ask why you chose that particular college? Urm well it's it's not eh eh ugly like I make it out. But urm my father went to veterinarian school in XXX14. It's one of the top veterinarian colleges in the country now. So he I was looking at one of his colleges, and I thought it was I thought it was pretty, and I like the XXX15 because the people are really friendly. Urm so I I sort of thought this seems hen it's a big school, but it doesn't feel like it. Hm. Hm. Hm. Er you feel like you're in a really small town when you're there. So I mean, it it's a good experience, and it's five hundred miles from where I grew up. Hm. So it's it's def I definitely threw myself out, and said, ""O K. Let's see what you can do here."". So it's been a positive experience mostly. laughter Good. Good. O K. Ur This isn't gonna happen in your hometown, but I want you to imagine this experience from the train O K. erm situation here. Shall I read this or? Yeah. If you could just read that to yourself. We're gonna try a role-play now. O K. Read that to yourself, and when you're ready, I'll begin. The interviewee is reading the card. Hm. <.> O K. Ur. O K? O K. Urm yes, good afternoon, sir. Can I help you at all? Oh my. Huh. I I missed my train because my car ran out of gas on the way here. And I'm on I need to get on this train I needed to get the train because I was going a very long distance to see my brother who is sick. Hmm. But on my way here, my car ran out of gas, and I had to run all the way here. So now, I have to go I have to call my mom to come pick me up and take me to another train station so I can catch a different train. Because this one and so I need to get this ticket refunded so I can buy a new ticket. Can you help me out in any way if possible? I would you know, I would love to help you out. It just seems so sad, but we we can't give refunds. I I really need this money. I n I have to go see my brother. He's deathly ill. This might be the only time I would ever see him. Now can you help me? I totally understand that. I totally understand that. But as far as the money goes, I mean I don't know you ran out of gas. Well I I really need this money back. I can can you find it in your heart to help me? I wou I have a heart, but it's a policy. Oh can can I speak to the manager, and we see if we can change this policy? laughter He I'm afraid he's not around at the moment. So. sigh And you're in a rush. I really I really need this ticket refunded so I can go see my sick brother. He's deathly ill. I mean, three hundred dollars, I'd like to help you out myself, but I just don't have that kind of money. sigh O K. Thank you anyway. Well I mean urm <.> ho er how much do you need? I mean, when when's your mother coming? Oh I I she's she should be here any minute, but she's indigent and poor, and she scrubs floors for living. laughter And this was all the money we had. And I missed my train. So now I have I have to go buy another ticket. Well ur And we have no money. I just can't arrange it right now. I I could you know, I mean if you I trust you. If like I could give you fifty bucks. And. Oh that that would be great. Any anything you could do. Maybe maybe I can arrange something else. Maybe you can wire it back later if I can get this refund? Oh that that would be great. O O K. Well now here's fifty to start with. Thank you so much. You're a saint. O K. Thank you very much. I I haven't been called a saint before. laughter O K, thank you. If I was a saint, I would've given you three hundred bucks. N never mind. That's true. Never mind. But you you do what you can. So this all these trains in Tokyo, it's bit of a new experience for you. Well kin last summer, it was it was awful. I mean because I come from a rural area and there're no trains. And then I come to Tokyo, and they s flash this huge map with hundreds of trains. And they say, ""O K, you live here. Get here."". And there're about three different trains you can take, and I was just like speechless. Because I I had no idea how I get from one point to the um to the next. And but by the end of my six weeks, I was pre I think I was pretty good. And then coming back, it was it's been over a year since I've been here so I was seeing I kind of remember. And seeing all the new people, they they're in the same boat I was last summer, they they said, ""How do we get from here to here? It's impossible."". And I was I I tried to tell people, you know ""It's not that hard."". It's actually very easy once you get diagram. And once you get I mean I see kids now and they're just like, ""Oh you need to get here from here? And you should take this line at this time, and it'll cost you this much."". So I mean it doesn't take long at all, but at first, you see that big map, and you're just intimidated with well a lot of things. What's the funniest thing you've seen on the train? Urm probably my friend laying down on the train laughter after we'd been drinking a while. And he said, ""I'm gonna lay down. You take a picture."". So and it was a pretty crowded train so he laid down, and I took and I took a picture. So it was . Yeah, I can imagine that. O K. I want to try another role-play with you. O K. We have a couple more to do. Um can I'd like you to read that to yourself, understand that situation. And again, when you're ready, let me know. O K. O K. Is that O K? That's fine. O K. We're doing this on the phone. Hello, this is ur XXX01 here. XXX01, ur I need you to help me out. I accidentally broke this window in my apartment. This is Tim, right? Right. Ah yes. You ur sorry, did you what? Urm well see, I locked myself out of my apartment. And I was trying to well break in to get my keys so I could, you know, get on my car and go somewhere. And when I was trying to slide the window back, it broke. And so now, I need to get it fixed as soon as possible because I'm going out of town, and I don't want this big gaping hole in my apartment. You ur yu if you had called me, you know, I have the master key. I mean that was a bit radical of you. Well I mean, I was I was in a hurry, and I wasn't thinking right. And your office is so far away. You know, I was just I was trying to get in and I wasn't thinking clearly and now, a window is broken and I need it fixed as soon as possible. Well listen, I mean, I'm really busy right now. I um maybe Thursday? Oh see I'm I'm catch I'm ta catching a plane tomorrow, and you know, I'm gonna be gone for three weeks. So I I don't really feel comfortable leaving the window just broken like this. Can you fix it sometime today? Ur well I'm in the middle of a game now. Er you know, it's it's the fifth inning. sigh I I don't know. I I'll I'll pay any kind of overtime. I'll pay for the window, I'll pay for your work. I'll tape the ballgame for you. laughter I mean anything so you can get this window fixed today. It'll really help me out. I would really appreciate it. Urm O K. Well then maybe I can <.> come down and watch the game at your place. Oh. That that would be fine. You can fix the window, watch the game. I've got a big T V. You know, you can do whatever you want. I I would really appreciate it. O K. I'll do that then. Thank you very much, then. Thank you. I'll I'll see you in a few minutes. Well it'll be about ten. I'll see you then. O K. O K. Thank you. O K, that's the end of that role-play. All right. You're living in a dormitory. No problems there? No, not right now. Urm none so far. We're not allowed to have girls in the dorm. But that's not a very big deal. Hm. Hm. Hm. I see all the Japanese guys with girls in there sometimes. So I don't know. I see. What a what about urm back at college, urm you your own campus? Urm I my freshman year, I lived in the athletic dorm on campus. And it was pretty strict on girls, too. So I'm I'm kind of used to that. But um last year, my sophomore year, I lived in an apartment in an apartment by myself. Pretty urm like a half mile off campus. So it was really nice to uh live by myself. And um it was it was a pretty large apartment for one person, too. So it was it was really nice, really. Going back to your freshman year, if you ur when you do have ur a problem, urm maybe with a roommate or maybe with some other people in the dormitory, what can you do about it? What's the procedure? Urm well there was um an ex-football player ex-American football player. Large large man. And he ran the dorm. So anytime we had problems, we we could call him or go knock on his door, and he would he would yell at us, but then he would take care of it. So he was he was an interesting man. I actually had to do that because I had to switch roommates after the first semester, because my roommate stopped showering and slept all day. And he was a real big nuisance, so I had to do that. ""XXX16, can you help me out? My room really smells really bad, and we need to get this guy out of here."" What what caused that change of lifestyle habit? Ur I it was the first year of college, and he was not doing well. I think he had mental problems or something. He just stopped showering, just laying there all day. I came back from a long weekend, and the smell was horrible. And I went straight down to XXX16 's office, and I said, ""Listen. You have to move him out now."". And it was pretty much the next day he moved out. So. It was and if you if there are people playing music too loud in the dorm, he wouldn't be very happy about that, but he would. He was kind of a serving person. But it it wasn't a bad real bad dorm situation. The dorm room was really small. Actually smaller than the dorm I have here Really? in Tokyo. And there were two people in it. Wow. So, that's it was kind of rough. That's why I never want to live in the dorm. laughter Or disinfect it. Yeah. That's right. laughter It took us a while. O K. Ur one more role-play we have to do. O K. The third one. Again, if you could just read through it, different situation now. You could read through that. laughter O K. <.> O K? All right. O K. Er yes. Uh good afternoon, sir. Can I help you at all? Yes. My wife and I booked this trip with your travel agency. And it was supposed to be the honeymoon of a lifetime. You know, Acapulco. It was supposed to be beautiful beaches and a fa luxurious honeymoon suite. And it turned out to be way less than we expected. The honeymoon suite was smaller than my dorm room in college. laughter The water was black. The bed fell apart the first night, and we ended up sleeping on the floor with a tattered mattress that looked like several people had done really awful things in. And the beach was closed due to a toxic spill off the coast. It rained. I know you have no control over the weather, but this just added fuel. We were supposed to have a full dinner package in the hotel, and it was Saltines and club soda at three in the morning after the room service didn't respond. So I I know your travel agency has direct control over this hotel because it's your travel agency. So I I we my wife and I are still scarred by this horrible honeymoon and now I'm back at work, and she is trying to recuperate from the some bacterial infection she got from the water. laughter So. Well sir, I mean the these are what we call acts of God. We can't control toxic spills and bacteria in the water. But the brochure I was given by one of your beautiful representatives had pictures of luxurious of a luxurious hotel, fine service, and it was way below that. And. Well so you understand we can't control local customs and local culture. But we were guaranteed this in the contract we signed, and you did not deliver it. So we would really like our money back. Airfare, maybe not. But it was a very expensive hotel, and we it was worse than anything we'd ever stayed in. We'd really like our money back. Well it does sound pretty bad. So I I'll I'll may I be excused to check the hotel? Our representative in Acapulco could go to the hotel? Well if if if I could I mean, we we know it's bad so we don't really need a second opinion. So if you could really just wire-transfer our money back, we would be really happy. Otherwise, I mean my brother is a lawyer. laughter And he he was not very happy with the pictures we showed him. So we have evidence. I mean I did take many pictures. Instead of beautiful beach, our broken down hotel room and the rat that carried away my wife's hat. laughter So if we could resolve this matter without having. It does sound pretty bad so I'm sure we can manage it. Thank you very much. You've been very respectful. I appreciate that. O K, thank you very much. O K, thank you. And our trip to hell is what that makes it s sound like. laughter Urm apart from Japan, have you been abroad at all? Urm I went to a cruise I cruised to the Bahamas once Wow. when I was a freshman in high school. So Well that. it's kind of out of the country, but not really. But it was an ex it was very nice. Sure. I mean uh uh tell me about that trip. Ur it was with my church youth group. And up until like that was like before me, because that was my first year in group, they went every spring break, because we're all from same high school, they would take a big trip out to San Francisco or something. And so we took a Carnival cruise for three days from Florida. And we drove to Florida, and then we took this really, really cool cruise down to the the two islands in the Bahamas. And it was it was really nice. Like we stopped at on the first island like we just got out and looked at the stops there, the stands the souvenir stands because of ur we had to get a taxi into town. We didn't really wanna do that. So we just and the boat was really nice. We could eat I think they served like twelve meals a day. And all we had to do was show our card, and you could eat as much as you wanted erm twenty-four hours a day. And I was in a room with two of my best friends, and we just oh we just had a great time. We owned that boat. And then on the second island, we got out, and walked around. And a native came up to us, and he offered us drugs, and started to lead us away. It's the really ghetto part of town. And so we got kind of scared, ran back to the boat. So that was interesting when we walked in the Bahamas. But the boat was really cool. And there was a storm one night, so the boat was rocking back and forth, and one of the girls got really seasick. And we got Cuban cigars and smoked down on the deck. And it made us really sick, too. So laughter I think I was green from the cigar. And urm then we got back to Miami, and drove the long trip back home. And it was it was really fun. And then after that, though, we didn't take any more trips for spring break, so Right. you know, it was a good spring break. Yeah. It sounds like fun. O K. Next up, I'd like to show you a sequence of pictures. It's not exactly a a cruise ship. laughter It's a a camping story. Urm this is a sequence of pictures here XXX02, O K. going from one to six. I'd like you to make up a story based on these pictures. Huh O K. Make up a story. Now, this happened before. So please start the story, ""One day last week"", and then begin. This is O K. One day last week. Urm well Janie was home from college. And her mother decided to take a mother-daughter field trip out ur a camping trip so that they could catch up on her first year of college and all the new experiences she'd had. So they decided to buy some camping gear, load up the car, and go to the park and camp. Ur when they arrived, it was beautiful. And they set it up they set up the tent, built a fire. And it was they they'd started bonding, and they were gonna cook marshmallows. And Janie was telling her mom about all about college and the new boy she was seeing. But then it started to rain and they said, ""Oh no."". Just nothing worse could have happened. And the storm started getting worse and worse. And they had to abandon their new tent in the campsite and jump in the car before this horrendous rain storm could ruin it completely. And they drove down the road a little bit, and they ended up seeing Hotel Cosmos in the lightnings, flashes of the terrible storm. And so they said, ""Well we can salvage this trip. Let's go drink hot cocoa, and we can reminisce in the hotel."". And so they after they took showers and cleaned themselves up, they ate hot cocoa in front of the big picture window in their new room. And they could enjoy the scenery just as the same as if they were in the tent. So they spent the weekend, and it was great. O K, thank you very much. O K. You mentioned the rolling hills of your homeland. Ur any camping-type experiences? Hiking, that kind of thing? Actually, yeah. Ur about two hours away from our hometown, there is XXX17. And it's I've heard of that. well it's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. My mom took my family one day ur and my friends. They are one it was actually like October, so it was actually too cold for us to be camping, but we decided to set up tent, and we had you know, there're like natural bridges, in the area, and there's all kinds of hiking, and it's it was falls, so all the trees, the leaves had turned colors. And it was really beautiful all night. In the morning we woke up, and it was below freezing, and we were all dying of cold, and we were trying to find firewood. And it was and we were like and a guy walked by, and we went ""Maybe he'll burn,"" and he heard us and he ran away. But it was it was really good. My brother had just started dating a new girl, and she was with us. So it was it was really cool. And there were two of my friends from high school. And we got we roasted marshmallows at night and and hu and we hiked around. And it it was really cool. And that was actually, my grandfather used to take me and my brother when we were little. So we've always liked going there. That's actually I'd like to go back there sometimes. And so it's it's really great. Very different from around here. Very different. Yeah. O K. One more little thing. Another sequence I need to do with you. O K. O K. In the same pattern, one to six, I'd like you to make up a story from the pictures, like this. O K. Ur again, it happened before, so please start, ""One day last week"". O K. Urm well it started out with Tim driving to work. And he was, you know, kind of rushing and thinking about things going back at home. And coming in the opposite direction was Jimmy, talking on his cell phone, driving on his moped, talking to his girlfriend about what they were gonna do that night. And the two the two people coming opposite ways, you know, Jimmy wasn't paying attention because he was driving his you know, he's talking on his cell phone. And Tim, he decided to make a turn really fast because he was late to work. And he crashed he crashed into the rear end of Jimmy's scooter er making him drop his cell phone. And they stopped because, you know, they were both worried about what happened. And Jimmy was complaining about his now busted headlight, and Tim was like, ""Well you were, you know, not paying attention."". So the cops come, and they're trying to explain both their sides. And so Tim explains to the officer, you know, ""Well he was talking on his cell phone, and I had the right of way."". And so the officer sides with him, and says, ""O K, you can go. Give me your insurance report."". And Jimmy has to call his friend, Moe, to ur come pick up his scooter and take it to the garage. And Jimmy is left on the street corner without a ride, without a cell phone, and pretty angry at the world. O K, thank you very much. O K. Now, presumably, not here, but back home, you have a car. Yes. I mean you can do nothing without a car. I it would be hard if I didn't. What is your car doing now? Urm actually I talked to my parents last night. My dad said every once in a while, he drives my car down the road and back, just to keep it going, the battery and things. So you drove back from from XXX12 to XXX06 just to put the car there? Well urm after s I took summer class this summer, and I had to move out of my apartment in XXX14, and I moved everything back to XXX06. O K. And urm yeah, I had to drive back. And then I had a few weeks at home, and all my stuff was there. And then I flew out of XXX06 to ur Washington and flew here. So. There's an airport near XXX08? Um we're thirty miles outside XXX09 There's an inter international airport there. Which means you can take a flight to another ur airport and get an international flight. Not reallyand int. Not really. I see. So. But that's not bad. No, it's not bad at all. So urm he's been I guess it's just sitting in our the driveway for the most part. Mm-hm. I guess every week or so to keep it all up. How ha have you ever had ur an accident or some problem with the car? Actually, the first acci a we less than a week before after I got my driver's license for the first time, I was driving with my friends, and there's a stop in my town that's kind of weird, and there's a yield sign. And every time I've been with my mom, she just quickly looked and just kept going. And so I didn't even think about stopping. And when I was halfway through the intersection, my friend yelled at me. And there was a car coming, and it pretty much hit us right where my friend was sitting in the passenger side. And it's at the top of a hill, and we pretty much almost went back down the hill in the intersection. And I had to turn the wheel, and we almost ran into a Hardy's, and ur it broke the axle on the curb. And it really messed my car up. And we all four of us were O K. And um I lost my car for like three months, I think, while they were fixing it. And it was like three thousand dollars of damage. And urm it was pretty awful. We were we were all unhurt. But er that was . But it didn't put you off driving. No. After that urm before that, I wasn't a very good driver, but it's after that, I've been s most spec spectacular driver I think ever. So um I've been taking care of that old car. It's been through a lot with me. Right. So, yeah. O K. O K. Well we're nearly at the end of the interview now, XXX02. O K. Urm what are your plans for the rest of the day? Urm actually, I have no idea. I think I'm gonna go check my e-mail, and send uh I send like weekly urr whenever something happens I send ar e-mail journal back home, and I save them, so I'll have some kind of journal when I get back home. Hm. Hm. And I'll probably write about the karaoke night this weekend. Sure, right. And probably about this test, actually, too. Urm and I'll probably write e-mail, and after that, I'm pretty much open. Maybe go home, maybe go back to campus. I don't know. All right. What about the what about the New Year? Do you are you still in Japan for the New Year? Urm no, I'll be going home on the twenty-first. So I'll be able to spend Christmas and New Year's at home. And then aft a few da a week after New Year's, I have to go back to college in the States. You're leaving on the twenty-first. So we're we're talking one week and a bit. Um December twenty-first. Oh December twenty-first. So. Oh O K. Yeah. So we ha we're we are winding down. It doesn't seem like it's been that long here. Well it's nice to spend Christmas at home. Oh definitely. I'm really excited about Christmas and New Year's at home. That'll be exciting. Sure. Sure. Well thank you very, very much for your time. And I hope you ur enjoy the rest of your stay here. Thank you very much. O K. Thank you.",0
"N_file00011.txt 2002-11-11 male 21 USA 1_12m Philosophy restaurant classroom invitation_advanced shopping_advanced landlord_advanced camping car accident XXX01. Nice to meet you. I'm XXX02. O K. How are you today, XXX02? Pretty well. How are you? I'm O K. Thank you very much. XXX02, do you live around here? Ur I live in XXX03 which is probably ur about an hour's commute away from here. Which direction? Ur north. O K. Is it in XXX04 or is? It's in XXX04. It's in XXX04. Ur that's pretty close to XXX05. Uhh O K. That's a bit of a distance. Yeah. How do you get here? Ur I take the train and actually, I start out in the morning, I take the bus to the station, I take three trains, and then walk from the station to the university. My God. laughter Yeah. Why do you live in such a place? Ur it was my unfortunate home stay assignment. laughter You didn't have a you didn't have a choice? Right. No choice. Uhh. O K. What's the place like? Ah it's nice. My family is ur family is really nice. Ur I don't have any complaints about them. It's just the distance that's trouble. Ur pretty nice, eat a lot of food, sometimes we talk. It's kind of difficult though, because I'm not very good at Japanese. So ur I mostly just eat with them, and then go to my room, and read or something. Mhm. What's the area uh uh like around there? Ah there's nothing. It's all just rice fields, pretty much. Urm basically, my house is in a rural division of homes that's surrounded by rice fields, laughter all directions. It's real real Japan. I guess so. Quite er more real than living around here. Yeah. Mhm. Uh. I see. And you've been in this program for? For two months now. O K. If I may ask, why did you decide to join this program? Urm I wasn't I don't know. Well I really just wanted to get out of the States for a while. And this is the program that my ur ur study abroad director suggested to me. So I went ahead with it. Well how how do you get on to this program? Mm is there a procedure involved? There's just tons of paper work. Hm. Urr just ur you apply, do a lot of paper work, ur get your passport, your air ticket, and fill out a bunch of forms. That's pretty much it. So pretty much anybody can join if they have the tolerance for that paper work. That and urm yeah, a certain grade requirements, I think. But ur I'm not sure what the exact exact numbers are on this. Still, you're enjoying it? More or less. O K, er that comes more. laughter O K. O K. What are you doing on the weekends? Urr sometimes I go out with friends, a lot of time I hang around the house and play guitar or I read or study. Urm since I live so far, it's difficult to do a lot of traveling like to Tokyo. So. Sure, sure. Sure. You brought your own guitar? Ur I bought one here. O K. O K. And what kind of music do you play? Ur it's it's acoustic guitar, and I play acoustic rock, folk, that sort of thing. Mm mm mm mm. How did you learn to play guitar? Ur started, I guess, when I was around thirteen. Mm. And ur I just played, and I took lessons for about a year. Since then, I've just been playing on my own and er just mostly writing music by ear. Never played in a band? Yeah. I played I played in some bands, and ur performed solo. Urm but I I pretty much prefer to play solo, I think. Mhm. Tell me about the last time you played a solo gig. Ur actually last time was probably ur three, four weeks ago. And it wasn't really a gig. I just ur I was at a party, and there was a performer there and played, and after he got off the stage, I grabbed his guitar and got up I played a number of songs. I'd had enough shouchu to convince me to do it. So. You got more applause than he did? I'd say so. laughter laughter Good, good. That's the important thing. O K. We have abo a few tasks that we have to do today, XXX02, if you don't mind. First of all, I'd like you to take a look at this picture, and I'd like you to describe this picture in detail. Ur it's a picture of a restaurant. The waiter is ur offering a bottle of wine to two people here in the foreground. And ur urr there's a number of wine glasses on the table. That's four wine glasses for two people, that's funny. In the background, there is a lady playing guitar and grandfather clock, two more tables and another waiter. Anything else? Ur there is a cart ur beside the waiter in the foreground. Ur it's got number of different bottles and glasses and boxes. And further in the background, there is some trees. Ur <.> there's a doorway with er some kind of rope strung across it. O K. O K. Now XXX02, since in in Tokyo or in the area where you are, have you discovered any good restaurant? <.> I've been to a number of places that I thought the food was good. Mm. Tell me about one of those places. Ur one of them was er very small. Ur only had two tables. Both were in laughter er both were in their own little private rooms. And ur it was it was actually a really fine meal. There was a lot of ur probably like nine courses, and ur ur really, really nice gourmet Japanese food. Ur <.> er lots of seafood, obviously. There was ur some fried shrimp involved or in another course is er scallops and fish and Wow. there's all kinds of different things. It's pretty. Pretty fancy for for a student on the XXX06 XXX06 program. Well my family took me there and paid for us. So. O K. O K. Urm apart from restaurant, have you been out at all at night um with friends Urr friends here? been to a couple of bars. Ur but ur I'm not really big on night life. O K. What was your impression of the Japanese bar? Urm mm <.> er I was really surprised that the beer is more expen so much more expensive than the liquor. It seems to be reversed than it is in the United States where liquor is usually more expensive, and beers less expensive. Mm. Ur but ur ur it's it's I think it's it's similar to American bar, I think. Except ur maybe not so many T Vs and sports paranoid. Mhm. Mm mm mm mm. Urm but ur you know, the same same social environment, I think. Same atmosphere. O K. O K. Now, we have one more picture to describe. If you could have a look at this one, and try to describe that in detail for me. Hm. Ur this looks a whole a lot like ur Japanese classes that I've been here because the students are completely not concerned with the class. laughter Ur there is a person blowing a bubble with gum and people talking, another guy listening to music and drinking ur something from the bottle. There is a girl playing with a telephone. And one person in the class in the front is paying attention. Ur the teacher is sitting in front of the board, and looks like she is frustrated, trying to ur teach the class. <.> Anything you think she could be doing to captivate their interest a little more? Ur well in this picture, she's not facing any of the students. Urm and er mm perhaps if she was speaking to the students or did something to demand their attention. Mm mm. O K. Thinking back to your own high school days, XXX02, how is this classroom atmosphere different from the high school that you went to? Ur in my high school, the classrooms didn't have windows. Urm so the windows there are different. Urm also people weren't allowed to use telephones cell phones or ur headphones for music. Urm and ur I think the students are more attentive during class. Yeah. Yeah. O K. Thank you very much. If I may ask, where where is home for you, XXX02? Ur originally, XXX07, XXX08 which is ur about thirty minutes from XXX09 and thirty minutes from the coast. So it's right in a corner of south-east XXX08. I see. I see. Until high school? Yes. O K. And then where is your college? Ur it's in XXX10, XXX08 which is ur north of XXX11 about twenty minutes from XXX12. And ur it's a really really small town, it's a really small college. It's about twelve hundred students. Mhm. And ur it's a liberal arts college so everyones there is little bit fruity. laughter And. Er. Can you explain to me what you mean by ""fruity""? Fruity. laughter Urm a little bit out of the ordinary, corky, urm maybe fall into beat of their own drum. Can you give me some examples? Urm. Well one example? Uhm. I would say that people probably ur dress ur less conventionally. A lot of hippies there, I guess. Ur and ur mm art hippies and musicians and actors. Ur and also a lot of the cour a lot of the majors that are acquired from college aren't typical majors. They're designed majors by the students. So that instead of graduating with a psychology degree, they invent a art psychology degree or something on those lines. Is that a is that a policy of the college, or is there something else that attracts such corky students to the college? Ur I really I have not figured that out yet. laughter I don't know what it is that attracts weird people. Ur. <.> Is there a eh a college policy to allow the students to create their own courses? Yeah. Yeah. So it must be well-known that tha that is a Right. college policy, Right. and that would attract people. Right. So long well long way from your it's in the same state, but it's a It's long way from home. it's about four hundred miles. Right. Very different environment, I would imagine. Ur yeah, as far as like the train is. Yeah. Could you compare the sort of Ur XXX07 ? is set in forest. There is huge trees everywhere. It's very humid because we're so close to the coast. Rains a lot. Ur and the land is completely flat. Ur and we're basically right at the sea level. Ur XXX10 is much more hilly. There're very few trees. And the trees that are there are very short. Urm winter is a very depressing time of the year there because everything is brown, Hm. and Hm. the few trees that are there have lost all of their leaves. You can see brown and gray floor of . So it's pretty desolate during the winter. Is there ur att attraction in that desolation perhaps? No, uh I really don't like the winter there. Mm mm mm. O K. O K. O K. I'd like to try some role-plays with you. O K. Urm yeah, I'd like you to imagine this urm scenario here. It's ur a party. If you could read this role-play card to yourself, XXX02, and when you're ready, I'll begin. The interviewee is reading the card. Hello? Uh ye uh uh O K? O K. We're doing it on the telephone. Hello, yes, this is XXX01 here. Hi, this is XXX02. Ohh XXX02. I wanted to ur apologize about not making it to your party. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. Ur it it's really a terrible thing that happened. I ur was I was actually on my way to your party when the tire of my van blew out. laughter And ur and I tried but I I went and pulled out my spare, but my spare didn't have enough air in it. And so I had to walk all the way down to the gas station to try to get an attendant, but the attendant was out. And so I ended up having to just call the tow truck and get them to tow my van in somewhere where I could get it get the air filled in my spare and just get a new tire for the one that blew out. So I ended up spending two or three hours t in this whole fiesta. So I'm really, really sorry. Well that's that's something, you know, I mean ur we were all waiting for you. Well ur I am I'm really apologizing. I know I know that it was a disappointment for you so ur I hope you won't hold it against me in the future. Well ur I certainly won't, XXX02. But you know, I mean you could've called. Well I probably could have, but I didn't have my cell phone with me, and and I was just in such a frustrated and panic state that ur it just really escaped my mind to call. I'm sorry. O K. Well I guess there's nothing that could be done. We'll have another party sometime. Thanks. O K, thank you very much. O K. That's the end of that role-play. Urm you said you don't ur go out much at night, XXX02. Ur i any particular reason for that? Ur I bodybuild. And ur so usually ur when I get home in the evening, ur I eat a lot of protein and ur maybe read a little and then go to sleep. Ur try to get eight or nine hours of sleep every night. So that I'll be ur rested and recovered for the next day. Wow. Er how did you get into bodybuilding? Ur. Healthy living? Well ur actually, laughter ur I got into working out to overcome a drug addiction. And ur also, I I I became serious about bodybuilding erm probab I I I well I became more serious about it after I dropped the drugs to ur just attracted to it basically. laughter Sure. It's a good as reason as any, yeah. laughter I could imagine. So er you have a pretty healthy urm food. How do you being here in Japan, how do you manage that? I mean the program you had at home is gonna be difficult here. Yes. It's it's difficult in Japan because the diet here is pseudo-protein, and is ur really high carbohydrates. And also carbohydrates that they have in their diet are of little quality, such as white rice and that sort of mixed with, you know, brown rice and that sort of thing. So ur everyday, I drink a couple of protein shakes. Ur usually start off in the morning with a half of dozen eggs or so. And ur I eat some salads and fruits and things. Urm then I go to class. um usually about three hours after breakfast, I drink ur protein shake maybe half of protein shake. Then for lunch, I'll eat some ur steak or chicken and eggs that are made at home, brought with me. Ur then I'll go work out in the afternoon. Afterwards, I'll drink another protein shake. And I go home, and ur cook some fish, urm some vegetables and ur maybe some other kind of meat. And ur I drink a lot of dairy and orange juice though the day. That's interesting. Urm a lot of people would say or I I hear that people say that Japanese food is very healthy. You would bit differ? Well it is healthy. Urr but as a bodybuilder, you have to take in a lot more protein than normal person. Ur I try to consume a gram of protein for every pound of my weight. And ur that's that's absurd for most among the people who aren't doing weight lifting. And ur it's unheard of in the Japanese diet to have that much protein. The ur it's it's definitely healthy food, but the ur portions here are very small. And ur like I said, the carbohydrates are ur low-quality carbohydrates . Very interesting. O K. I'd like to I'd like to do another one with you if I may. Urm yeah. O K. That's shopping scen scenario. Again, if you could read that to yourself, and then when you're ready, let me know. The interviewee is reading the card. It can be anything. O K. tap O K. Yes, good afternoon, sir. Can I help you? Yes. Ur I'd like to return or try to exchange this sweater that I got. Ur I realize that you don't typically allow exchange. But ur a very special circumstance. Urm I'd like to hear it. Well my younger brother who I bought this sweater for had died last night. Uhh that is ur too bad. Yeah. It really is. And you know, I was really looking forward to giving laughter to giving this sweater because it was his favorite color, blue. And he died. Ur yeah. Well urm ur that is a very terrible thing, sir. I'm sorry to hear it. Urm. But you know we're. I I can't exactly give it to him now. Please have a heart and take this sweater back. Ur you know. Or just give some socks or it explains. laughter Huh I wou you know, I'd love to help you, sir, but ur what can I do? I mean a policy is a policy. I'm sure it would fit fit you in. Does your policy have no room for humanity? It does. It does. Urm or it would look good on you, it would be a nice ur token of er remember. laughter Except he's three sizes too small, I can't even get it over my shoulders. Ur he was ur a small chap, I presume. Yes, he was very small and died. Urm. He died very small and pitifully. Well I ur it's so it's a tough one form me, sir. I mean we don't hear have this very often. It was leukemia. Uhh. He'd been suffering for years. We have to just ur ask our manager about this, I'm afraid. And he's not around. So. Well what would be a good time to come see your manager? Ur. Maybe ur a couple of days from now. You know, he is an area manager. He's never had a case like this before. You don't have a mana direct manager in the store on daily basis? A store the store manager i would be back in twenty minutes. I'm not sure if he can decide this, though. All right. Well I'll come back and discuss it with him then. O K. You can understand it's a very terrible situation, but it's a very unusual one for us. Well laughter it's very unusual for my brother to be dead right now. laughter I see, sir. Ur I'll do my best. O K. Thank you very much. O K. laughter O K. I don't know what the um the staff at Mitsukoshi would do with that one, but never mind. Er. laughter How have you found service so far in Japan at shops? Ur service is ur I mean everyone is is willing and ready to lend their service. It's kind of irritating ur walking into, or not even having to walk into store, but just walking past the store, and hearing six people from inside shouting, ""Irasshaimaseeee"" like non stop. It's you know it's it strikes me as it's strikes me as so interesting that the way that Japanese people communicate in a polite way happens to also be the most annoying way they could possibly try to communicate with you. Ur so urm I I t I actually I I try to avoid shopping and that sort of thing. Just or try to do it all at once so that I don't have to deal with all of the irasshaimasens. Right, right. Urm but ur on the whole, I mean if I need something or if I'm looking for something, urr they're more than willing to, ur you know, help and try to er understand my broken Japanese to get me what I want. You mentioned earlier your ur urm the ur your host family being very kind. Right. How have you well oh hav not have you, but how have you try to to repay that in a sense? Oh. Urm well I ur I help everyday I help my host mother everyday with cooking. Uh. Urm which I assume that she takes that as some sort of reciprocation, but I think it's probably er more self-centered because I really like to learn how to cook Japanese food anyway. Uhh. Um but ur also, sometimes they wanna do something that I don't really wanna do. And ur I go along and do it anyway just because it's something that they would like to do with you. And. Can you give me an example of something like that? Ur like sometimes they all want to go on a tri on a bus tour or would like to travel to some place to see something. And sometimes it's very interesting, sometimes something that I'd like to. Other times, it's something that I'm not particularly interested in. Well I go ahead and go with them anyway. Urm also urm my host family's asked me to do a favor to her which is to dress up a Santa Clause in December, laughter and hand out presents to children ur for one of her friends. And as much as I despise Christmas and Santa Clause, laughter I agreed to do it anyway. That that was extraordinary kind, I think, ur in the circumstances. laughter O K. One of more of these role-plays. Like it again, change the scenario. The interviewee is reading the card. And this one's on the phone. The interviewee continues reading. Hello? Uh O K. I I'll start, yeah. Hello, urm this is XXX01, the building manager. Hi, XXX01. This is XXX02 in Apartment one B. Oh XXX02, what's up? Ur I've got a kind of problem here. Ur my nephew threw a Frisbee, and it went right through the window. Oh dear. And ur so it's it's wide open right now. I'm ur trying to cut some cardboard out because it's really freaking cold and ur the wind's blowing in, and I can't keep the apartment warm. Ur I'm really sorry about it, ur but we need to get this window repaired pretty quick. I yeah. I can see that. How I can make it maybe Wednesday, Thursday. Ohh it's not soon enough. It's Sunday today. I can't keep the apartment warm hardly. Ur what about ur Monday or Tuesday? Urr possibly Monday. I mean you could just urm put some cardboard. Well I could I could maybe drop some trash plastic trash bin covers, and you could stick those out of the window? Yeah. I don't like that, though because I'm afraid somebody might break in. Oh come on. It's Japan. No, it doesn't happen. Yeah. That's what they say until it really happens to you. I would really like to get this window repaired pretty quick. O K. Urm I can give you a directory. I can't do it myself. I can drop off the Yellow Pages and you can maybe look somebody up and. You're telling me that I'm paying fifteen hundred dollars, what's that in yen, I don't even know, like to er a month for this apartment, and you won't repair this window for me? Come on. It ur your cousin threw a F Frisbee. Nephew. Your nephew threw a Frisbee through the window. It's hardly my responsibility. It is your responsibility to maintain the property. Ur banning your nephew from doing Frisbee? No. It just you know, problems come up, and you gotta fix them when they come around. Well let me see. I guess I ur it's Sunday. O K. Er at the earliest, tomorrow morning, it means you're gonna have to endure it another night. That's that'll be fine as long as it's repaired tomorrow. O K. We'll be down then. Thank you. O K. Thank you very much. O K. Now, of course, you won't have this problem at um in in Japan. But back ur at the campus, your your what sort of the accommodation do you have? Urr at the university, you mean? At the university. Not here, sorry. Oh at home? Back back home. Ur I spent the last two years living in a dormitory ur which was both a good and bad experience. Urm it was good because it's right on campus, and literally from my dorm room, anything on campus is about a three-minute-walk away. Ur so as far as ur saving time and being efficient, it's really good in that regard. But the rooms are small. My roommates weren't always agreeable. Urm. The. In what sense? Well ur you know, I like I said before, ur my lifestyle, I come home, I eat or read and I go to sleep. And I don't really have a problem with, you know, somebody going out and living wild a life at night, and I encourage that if that's something that they wanna pursue. But ur it would bother me when they come ur in and be very noisy, ur you know, in the middle of the night, and they wake me up and that sort of thing. Ur and I tried to explain to them, you know, it's it's only doesn't take much effort to be courteous and just, you know, not slam the door on your way in or, you know, not talk loudly, that sort of thing. Ur so that was ur troubling at times. Ur also, living on campus, you had to ur subscribe to a meal plan with the school cafeteria. And ur it didn't always ur meet my standards for cuisine Mm mm mm mm. acceptable cuisine. Ur but ur definitely some upshots are there's a nice gym and I can go and work out at. And ur like I said, everything is really close. Urm most of the students live on campus so there's urm a lot of ur uh everyone is really connected, you know where everyone lives. You can just go knock on their door if you need them because you know right about where they live or you can, you know, find out their phone number and dial it up on campus or something. Yeah. So it's pretty easy. Great. O K. O K. Two more things we have to do. Urm so I'd like you to ur yeah, look at the sequence of pictures here. It goes from number one to number six like this. I'd like you to make up a story based on these pictures. And the story happened before so I'd like you to begin, ""One day last week"". And then go. O K. Thanks. One day last week, Cindy and Sally decided to go camping. They packed their car full of all these things. They had backpacks and tents and pots and even firewood. They got to the campsite, and set up the tent, and built the fire, and started to cook their food when all the sudden, it started to rain. It was a terrible, horrible rain, and the wind swept in most brutally. The tent was swept up in this in a whirlwind of in a whirlwind. laughter And Cindy and Sally frantically began to pack everything that they had unpacked back into their car. They then drove to a hotel eh through the rain, through the lightening, and got a room where they sipped coffee and stared out the window at the star. The end. You've got a uni-Brighton tone there. laughter O K. Thank you very much. A what tone? Ur yeah. That's a very British thing so. Oh really? Yeah. Sorry. Um now, out in XXX08, I presume er that is the big outdoors. You you've been camping, hiking quite a bit? Yes, yes. Can you tell me about one of the last trips you took? Actually, ur I had an experience very much like that one right there. laughter Urm I I was with my girlfriend, and we had set up a camp. And ur we'd spent one night there. The next day, we got up and ur left and ur drove into town leaving our tent and everything set up because we planned to go back. Urm on the way back, it start to storm really, really badly. Urm and ur I was actually driving on my way to the park, and the road was cut off. And I was pulled over by an officer. He said I couldn't go any farther because everything was washed out and it was just too dangerous with the storm. Wow. Ur I explained to him that I had my tent and all my stuff set up there, and he thankfully let us go. And we got there, and the tent was knocked over, and it was full of water, and everything was soaking wet and ruined. So we threw it all in the back of my truck, and drove to a hotel, and ur stayed there for the night. And dealt with the mess the next day. Very, very similar. Worse than this, I ur think. Yeah. O K. And finally, one more sequence of pictures for you. O K. Again, from one to six, the same sort of pattern to make up a story that happened before. And start again with ""One day last week"", and make up the ur story there. The interviewee is looking at the pictures. One day last week, Sam was driving his car down the road. Simultaneously, Jim was driving on his moped ur thoughtlessly talking to his girlfriend on his cell phone. Ur he wasn't paying attention obviously when Sam knew Sam came and crashed into his moped on the side. His cell phone fell and broke, and his taillight was broken also. The police officer was called. And Sam explained to the police officer the reason that the wreck occurred was because Jim was talking on the cell phone. This obviously made Jim very upset. Ur very soon, after a ticket was written and given to Jim, ur a man in truck came by, and hauled off the broken moped. The end. The end. O K. Thank you very much. Now, I would imagine that either XXX07 or the place in the north of XXX08 or one of those places where there's no public transportation. Up in here in . Ur how do you feel about all these these trains suddenly? Ur I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, ur it's definitely a necessity for the people that live here. Ur the roads here are really narrow, and not very many people have cars. And gas is very expensive. So it makes sense that a lot of people ride the train. Ur but it's very frustrating for me because I'm used to driving around in my truck, and getting somewhere when I wanna get there, and getting there fast. Ur trains are aren't fast here urm simply because you have to wait for them to get there. You have to board them and travel and stop at each place. And once you get to your final ss stop, then you have to walk to wherever you're going. So it's really slow, and it's frustrating. Urm and so it's probably transportation is probably a thing that I hate most about Japan. Um. But bearing in mind the realities of the population, do you think there could be any other way around? I'm not saying I'm not saying that ur you know, I I I think it's I think the trains are definitely necessity here in Japan. Ur I don't I don't think that the population could deal without it. Ur so it's just it's something I have to deal with, I guess. Probably very rarely taken the train before you came here. Yeah. I've only er in the States, I think I've ever been on the train once or twice. Mm. Mm. I would imagine. Right. Right. And ur I've never been on the public bus before I came here either. Wow. What's your truck doing now? Ur it's sitting in a shop er in my my father's shop. Ur he'll drive it around every once in a while to keep it warm. Mm. Mm. Hm. Ur it's just waiting for me. I see. Yo and you're looking forward to getting back there. laughter Definitely. laughter O K, XXX02. It's almost the end of interview then. Urm tell me, what's your plans for the rest of the evening? Same as usual? Urr I was actually I gotta go to Sudanuma and talk to my cell phone company and get them to turn my cell phone back on. There was a problem where my Debit card denied the ur Debit right for some reason. And so they cut off my service. So now I have get all get it worked out, and get my phone back on. And in Japanese, er negotiation? Ur well actually, ur I had someone write down laughter what wanted to say in in Japanese. So I can just present them with that paper, and have it all fixed hopefully. Right. Well good luck with that. Good luck with that. And urm and then go home? Right. From Sudanuma, not too bad? About an hour. Still a long way. Mm. That is a long way. I think it's more that you've got a bit of an unfortunate circumstance. Yeah. I really with three train three trains and a bus? Mm. That's that's bad by Japanese standards. So Yeah. Yeah. kind of got, ur what you call it, the long end of the st Short end of the straw. uu the short end of the straw on that one, I think. Yeah. But urm mm too bad. I guess it's a potluck thing. Yeah. Yeah. O K. Well thank you very much for your time today, XXX02. Yeah. Thank you very much. O K.",0
"N_file00012.txt 2002-11-14 male 20 USA 1_12m International Affairs restaurant map travel_advanced shopping_advanced train_advanced car accident camping My name is XXX01. Can I have your name, please? XXX02. XXX02? Yeah. Can I call you XXX02? Sure. Sure. O K. How are you today, XXX02? Fine. How are you? I'm O K. Thank you very much. You had a good morning so far? Urr kind of. I'm tired. But, you know, so is life. I don't sleep very o much in Japan. Any particular reason? Urm I don't because I have to wake up really early, like seven in the morning. And in America, I make it so that my classes start at like eleven, which means I have to wake up at ten-thirty. So I I like to sleep later and go to bed later. Too early. Right. So now you're going to bed later, but waking up early. Wake up earlier. Yeah. I see, I see. Any reason you have to wake up so early, or? We have classes <.> well today, we have a class at nine, and uh with the commute, I'm like, waking up and getting there, I'm an hour and a half away. You're an hour and a half away from here? Yeah. With the with waking up and getting to the station . Ahh. Though I'm, like, probably live the closest of anyone. I see. Yeah. It just takes you a long time to get going in the morning, Yeah. I guess. Where do you actually live? XXX03. It's one stop from XXX04, toward Tokyo. O K. So that's on this line on Keiyo Line? On o on the XXX05 Line. On the XXX05 Line. Yeah. O K. What's the situation there? It's a dorm. So it's just me and my fish in the dorm room. Your fish? Yes. I got fish because my room was kind of bland. laughter Er why fish? Um because that's the only pet I could have that wouldn't run away if it would get out of the cage. laughter Because they die if they get out of the tank. O K. O K. And what what wonderful precautions are you taking to make sure that your fish doesn't die? Urm cleaning the water every two weeks and feeding them once a day. That's. Ur. And I have a snail to clean the tank. So. You have a snail, too. Yes. So two pets? Yeah. They have names? Um kind of, but I always forget them. laughter laughter O K. Urm may I ask, ur what are you actually studying here? What are you doing here? Urm well I started taking Japanese in high school. Urm but then when I got to college, ur my first semester in Japanese in college did my whole two years of Japanese in high school. But anyway, so I took Japanese and I'm interested in Asia and international affairs, and I decided to come to Japan. Mhm. And here, I'm taking ec Japanese economics, Japanese politics, and Japanese. Mm. So it's kind of. What made you become interested in Japan or Japanese in the first place? Because when I was in high school, my options were Spanish, French and German. And I didn't wanna take Spanish, French or German. Because everyone takes Spanish, French or German, so I decided to take Japanese <.> I guess to be different, when I was in eleventh grade. You could've taken Mongolian. No. It was just Spanish, French, Japanese and German. Yeah, Ohh Jap. were the options. Uh ur so within that. Right, within that, I picked Japanese. And you are in the minority. Yes. How was? It was like thirteen kids in my class. O K. How was the I I I can't imagine a a Japanese class in the U. S. How was the class? Um it was ur it's fine. My teacher was Japanese. And well it was really slow in high school. But in college, it's it's pretty fast-paced, and our teachers are Japanese. So it's actually much faster-paced than our Japanese class in Japan. So and much harder. Um just a lot of vocab and grammar and kanji. Mm. All that. Wha what do you actually or what did you learn in in high school? I mean, you don't know a single word. How do you start off? Urm I guess we started off with like, particles was the first thing, like grasping the concept of ""wa"" and ""ga"" and ""wo"" and why they exist. And then introducing like um uh like easy vocab and learning the basic, like, verb um structures, like ""masu"" and ""mashita"" and ""mase"". And building from there. Mhm. I see. And has that paid off now? You can you can? Yeah, I can chat in Japanese, which is nice, to be able to speak a foreign language. Because usually like if I go to Europe, I have to rely on people speaking English. Mm. Which they usually do. Mm hm hm. But and they usually do in Japan, too, but it's fun to speak Japanese. Mm hm hm. So. Oh that's good. Have ur and you've been going out a lot? Yeah. Tell me about the last time you went out. Like to ah like out at night? Yeah. Um well last time I went out at night, I stayed out all night in Shibuya. Wow. And we went to urm this really bad hip-hop club and this fun techno club. Then I started falling asleep at like four. And so we went to a ramen shop, and I slept. And my friends ate. And then we got on the train and I came home when the trains opened again at five. When you say it was a bad ur hip-hop club and good techno club or Like the club? the hip-hop was, it was bad music, I thought. Because you don't like hip-hop or? No. Because it well I like hip-hop, kind of, but it was just bad hip-hop. Like it was like top-forty music, you know, turned into hip-hop, which is not hip-hop. But anyway <.> it was bad. So it was pretty bad. Yeah. Ur and the fun techno, oh how uh uh uh uh could you explain what you mean by fun? Um well I really like techno. So um but it was good um I don't know, it's I when I go out to clubs, I like techno because I it's I think it's funner to listen to when you're out and drinking and dancing and I don't know. But a lot of other people think hip-hop is but fun, but I like good good music Hm. Hm. Hm. thereby allowing me to have fun. Right. Right. Or making it fun, yeah. How do you find these places? Urm let's see. We found one of them because my friend XXX06 went there with her host dad after a fashion show. And we found the second one from wandering in Shibuya. Just walking around and looking and listening to the music from outside. Just decided to And then decided to go in, yeah. walk in there. Yeah. Mhm. I see. O K. Tell me a little bit about your ur dormitory situation. I mean, I know your room, but the dormitory itself. Right. Um well like there're sixty people living there. I think about sixty. There's a cafeteria urm which they serve breakfast and dinner. And breakfast is from like six to eight-thirty, and dinner's from six-thirty to ten-thirty or eleven-thirty. I'm not sure, I never eat that late. But ur and s there's like community iss there's two bathrooms on each floor. So about half the people on each floor share bathrooms with toilets and sinks, and then downstairs there's a shower room with like five showers. Which actually, for some reason, is never really crowded, even though there's sixty people. Mhm hm hm hm. So there's always you can always go to the bathroom and use a shower. Right. Well it sounds pretty good. Yeah. It's not bad. O K. I have a lot of things to do with you today, XXX02. First of all, I'd like to show you a picture. This picture here. And I'd like you to describe that in detail. O K. O K. Well this looks like a fancy restaurant. Could be anywhere um because the waiters are wearing tuxedos and everyone at the restaurant is very dressed up in dresses and suits or jackets and ties. And there's also someone playing the piano, with a grandfather clock, and a and a red rope, which makes it look very exclusive. And urm the waiter's walking around, showing the wine, which reminds me of when I used to work at a restaurant and I had to show wine in this fashion. Um and urm oh and also, the food comes out in on like the plates with the covers. And there's two wine glasses at every table. And, like, fancy tablecloths draped over the tables. O K. Um you mentioned that you used to work at a waiter as a waiter. Tell me something about that experience. Ur well it was actually cool. I worked at um like the only nice restaurant in my I live in an the island in XXX07. And this lady moved from XXX08, kind of fluffy, like artsy cook, you know that like they like a chef that's like all about creating food as an art. Mm. Um but she moved from XXX08 to open like a coastal seafood restaurant where I live. And I got a job there. And it was called ""XXX09."". And it was really nice. It wasn't like fancy like we didn't have to we just had to wear a black shirt and khaki pants. And you could dress casually when you came. But it had like expensive food and and good wine. And it was all about, you know, presenting the wine and corking it correctly and pouring like while you turn the wine, you know, proper way to pour wine and bringing the food out properly when it's hot. And so I learned how to like wait tables, in the, like, not throw-the-food-on-the-table manner. You know, in like ah proper manner. Right. Right. What was the training like for that? Oh actually, they said I picked it up really fast, but I just trained for two days with this girl, XXX10, who I worked with. And urm I guess they taught me like oh the main thing to learn at this restaurant was like all the terms for the food that they would use. Like, I still don't know what a aioli is. laughter Do you know what an aioli is? Well we had to describe things like, ""This has, you know, a lime pimento aioli,"" or like, um ""A chipotle sauce, which is, like, similar to hot peppers."". Like so that was the hardest part, picking up all the like fancy food terminology, and then having to translate to people when they were like, ""Well what's that?"". . Right, right. Well that's, you know, plum-persimmon reduction or, like, you know. So there was a lot of translating. laughter That was the hardest part about it. O K. How how how has, ur restaurants been in Japan? Have you been to a nice restaurant? No, I have not actually been to a fancy restaurant. O K. What what was the best restaurant you've been to in Japan so far? Urm probably the sushi restaurant I went to last Fri it was Friday. It was like huge pieces of sushi. They were really fresh and good. And I really like sushi. It's probably my favorite food in the world. So that was like well when my mom comes, she's coming on the seven eighteenth of December. Then I'm sure I'll eat at a fancy restaurant. But with the money constraints, I'll have to wait till then. Yeah. Forget the peppermi ur Yeah. the persimmon-plum. Plum. Yeah, right. Yeah. O K. Ur next up, I'd like to show you a a map of a town. And I'd like you to describe, again, in detail, what you see there. O K. Well ur the town seems to be wedged in between the South River and the North River, with the train station assuming this is north, beside the North River, with the train station on the northwest side of the town. Urm it actually kind of looks like Amsterdam. But urm the way it's like spread out from the train station. But urm on the main road from the train station, you have the bank and I guess the offices of the town. Urm and in the next block is the restaurant, and the next block is the supermarket, with the bookstore catty-corner from the supermarket. Urm behind the supermarket um across the street from the South River is the movie theaters. Down Route four forty-four from the movie theaters is the post office and the bus station. And then if you take a right at the bus station, you'll see the hospital. If you take a left past the hospital, on your left is the public library. And if you go down the road that the library's on, you'll see the school. And also on the North River is a zoo and Riverside Park. O K. So what's your impression of this town? Urm it looks very urr much like Anywhere, U S A. laughter Or Anywhere Anywhere. But ur it's nice that they're on two rivers. Hm. Most towns in the world, though, are settled on rivers. So it's pretty typical. And ur it has a train station, so I know it's not where I live, because we don't have trains. laughter O K. It's probably nowhere in America, because we don't have trains. Urm yeah. O K. Wonderful. Now, you mentioned where you do live is on the coast, right? Right. I live on the coast. O on an island? On an island, yeah. Wha what's what's that like, living on an island? Urm well it's a big, touristy place, so all the all the, like, summer jobs revolve around tourism. Like, I've worked at a a T-shirt shop, where I made T-shirts and sold them to tourists. Um but it's not like a it's not an island like most people are probably thinking. It's a it's there's the mainland of XXX07 then there's three rivers with marsh in between the rivers, like marshland. And then the island, and then the ocean. Mhm. So there's bridges over the um rivers to get to the island. So it's not like Hawaii or uh Bermuda or Rhode Island. Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm. Yeah. And there's islands all like up and down the East Coast of America. They're called the Barrier Islands, I think. Yeah. But it's it's nice. It's it's like semi-tropical, so it's not like there's no palm trees naturally. But it's got it's got really mild winters and really hot summers. Um and the water's not blue, because the rivers pour all the silt, like all the dirt - not pollution, but dirt - into the ocean. So the ocean is really brown. But it's still nice and warm. And you don't get dirty if you swim in it, so. I've heard those Barrier Islands get battered sometimes by storms and. Yes, by hurricanes. But XXX07 is the United States from XXX11 to XXX12 goes in and out like it makes like a kind of a big semicircle. And so what usually happens is hurricanes bounce off XXX13 around XXX07, and hit XXX12. Like the last time we've only been hit by like two hurr three two hurricanes in our history, one in nineteen-on-two and one in nineteen-fifty-something. So you missed those. Because. Right. Because of the way that XXX07 is kind of in a little cove. O K. Well what's it like ur growing I um born in XXX14. Right. Wha wh what's it like growing up on an island? Um it's actu well it's an island. It's also in the South. Um there's there's not much there. There's very there's probably a hundred and fifty kids my age. So in my class well I went to a private school, so my class had twelve kids. Twelve to fourteen to eight, some years. And the public school had like a hundred and fifty kids. And that was the that was the town. So there's it's I wouldn't wanna raise kids there. But my parents like it. It's more of a place that older people would like and the kids don't like. Just because there's nothing to do. You know, the highlight would be going to see a movie. You know, or yeah. So it's not it's nothing like growing up in a city, which I'd rather do, which is why I go to school in XXX15 which is kind of more of a city than where I live. Well a lot a lot more of a city. laughter Yeah, a lot more of a city. Yeah. O K. Thank you very much. I'd like to do a role-play with you, if I may. I'd like you to imagine this scenario, XXX02. If you could just read through that, basically. Get the idea. Aloud, or? No, no, no, to yourself. No, O K. laughter Um and when you get the idea, I'll start. The interviewee is reading the card. Uh she reminds me of my mom. Well I'm not gonna be your mother. I'm gonna be your travel agent. O K. Urm O K. You ready? Mm hm O K. Ur good morning, sir. Can I help you at all? Ur yes. Um I booked a trip with you to Tanzania. O K, yes. Um and I was guaranteed that it would be a very, very nice trip. But um I'm currently in Tanzania, and it is far, far below my expectations. The hotel is not a five-star hotel. It is nowhere near the beach, even though you said it was on the beach. It does not have a pool. And the room was dirty when we got here. Well you have to understand, sir, that ur ur five-star in local terms is different from perhaps what you expected in American terms. Mhm. Um I would think that, in that case, that you should have probably um notified us that it was Tanzanian five-star rather than American five-star. Because the price seems to be comparable to an American five-star hotel. That's the state of the eh Tanzanian economy of of late. Mhm. Um is there any hotels near to the one we're staying in right now that maybe up is there Ritz-Carlton near here or Erm. anything that we could be guaranteed it'd be nice? I don't know, sir. And it would take a long, long time to arrange that for you. Anyway, I can't imagine that the room is dirty. It was dirty and had roaches on the floor when we got there. Well it's a tropical country, sir. I mean, what can you expect? Urm well I would've at least expected it to be um a little nicer. But nevertheless, there is a a travel agency right down the street from ours um in our town. And so I guess after I get off the phone with you, I think I'll check with them and see if there's anything nicer in this town that we could stay in. Well of course, you're free to do that, sir. But I'm ur I don't think we can do anything with regard to a a or refund or anything like that. Urm. I didn't know about the pool. There must be er local repairs, I would imagine. Well I would think that that maybe for for future references, you should probably tell people um <.> the truth about this hotel. Well err it's rather shocking, sir. I'll ur I'll have to try to find out myself. O K. Thank you. O K. Well thank you, and ur I'm sorry about that, sir. O K, thank you very much. . I probably should've asked for my money back, but. Probably, probably. laughter Never mind. Urm I presume you haven't been to Tanzania. But you've been abroad Yeah. elsewhere apart from Japan? Yeah. Any troubles on your trips? Troubles? No. Never had a problem. Mhm besides like maybe a flight being delayed. Like I always think the places we're staying is fine. My mom often makes complaints like that. Like they're not what she thought they would be. But I never have any trouble with it. Well. But I'm much easier-going. Yeah. Like I backpacked in Europe this summer. So with a backpack, staying in hostels. So I don't really. Ahh O K. It's all good for me. Yeah. What was the best experience in staying in a youth hostel? Urm well you actually, when we went to Switzerland, we stayed at this place called the Funny Farm, in Interlaken. Urm I don't know if you know where that is. But it's urm I know. it's kind of like an all-inclusive like place for um kids to go, like they have, like, on the property, they have a bar and a pool. And like it's in an old like Swiss mansion, but it's the rates are really cheap. So me and my friend got a room for uh like the equivalent of twenty euros, which is like twenty dollars, which is like three thousand yen. Um a room for the two of us with two beds and and a shower. That's pretty good. In like the mountains of Switzerland. So that was quite nice. And also, I stayed in f uh with that friend, XXX16 XXX16, who I went to Switzerland with, I stayed in Florence for a week, in Italy. Which Florence was really nice. Hm. I went to all the museums and uh old buildings and up into the mountains and all that. It was quite nice. Sounds good. Interlaken's a nice place, yeah? Yeah. All around there. O K. One more role-play for us. This is a uh shopping scen scenario. The interviewee is reading the card for a while. O K. O K? I'm gonna be the nice, friendly shop staff. Mhm. O K. Yes. Urm good morning, sir. Uh how may I help you? Hi. Um I recently bought this sweater um for my son. But urm I got home, and I realized that he does not like it at all and will never ever wear it. And so I was wondering if there is any way that I could exchange it for something of equal or lesser value, or get a store credit that I can use later. I see. And, uh may I ask, how old is your son, sir? Urr eight. And in eight years, you don't know what he likes and what he dislikes. Ur that's not the issue we should be discussing currently. I'm asking you if we couldur if we could ur exchange or refund it. But no, he doesn't often with little boys, you don't know what they like. I s. Same thing happened to me when I was a little kid. Yeah. Unfortunately, sir, as you as you can read on the sign, we we have a policy against refunds or exchanges. That's why I asked you about that. Mm. So there's absolutely nothing we could do. Well I didn't say that, sir. But urm you have to understand it puts me in a difficult position. Right. If I could go to the shelf and find something of equal value, bring it up here, show it to you, same price, and walk out of the store, I don't see what the problem would be. The problem may be that your son wouldn't like that either. That's true. And then I'd have to go home and suck it up, and give it to the Salvation Army. laughter Urm I see, sir. Well I can't really decide this myself. The manager will have to decide this. He's he's uh he's rather busy now. I don't think he would be back for a while. Can you hang around? Sure. Maybe. I can go next door. There's a Barnes and Noble. laughter I could read and get a cup of coffee. O K. Urm well if you could wait for an hour, then, sir, and come back, I'll do that. urm I'll do my best for you, then. O K. O K. Thank you very much. Sure. O K. You could you're gonna give it to ur you could've given the first one to the Salvation Army. But never mind. laughter Yeah. How is ur how do you find shopping in Japan? How is the service? Um they scream ""Welcome"" a lot um which I find a little odd urm because they're just screaming ""Welcome."". But as far as service, I haven't actually been shopping like well once I asked this lady, I was shopping and I was like, ""Where're the pants?"" And she like pointed and she said, ""Pants desu."". So that's my that's my that's as far as service has gone for me. But I've heard that if you go into like nice stores, they're very accommodating. Like, I always see people like they'll take your credit card while you're standing there, and they'll go and run to the counter, run to the counter and swipe it and come back to you, which they don't really do in America. So it seems if you're in nicer stores, like in Seibu, like, which has a lot of um like nice st nice little stores, like I notice that they seem to <.> be giving a very good service. Better than in America. Hm. Because a lot of times, there's service without a smile in America. laughter If you go to McDonald's, the people are smiling, in Japan. Right. Which is weird to me, because I wouldn't be smiling if I was working at McDonald's. But laughter they are. But you were smiling when you were working as a waiter. Right. . No, but I had a see I had fun, but also you ma I made an excessive amount of money waiting tables in a nice restaurant. So no matter how hard it was, after four hours, if you make two hundred dollars, that's <.> a lot of that makes anyone smile, so Sure. yeah. Sure. Sure. And it was a summer job so it was and we could d and we drank in the bar after work every night. So. Mm. At the restaurant's bar. So it was fun. A lot of people do complain about the the service in in U S stores. Um I I'm not American, but ur for the customer, ur how do you get used to that? Uh is there is there a technique to get used to bad service Well or expect it? it I think that's more so in the North than in the South. Um like in New York, sometim like in the South, you never yo people are smi like, it's more like Japan. You get better service. People are smiling, like um there's always, you know, ""Welcome, come, please sit down."". Like urm but I but then, like, you tend to be feisty back to them. Like if or a lot of times, if they're being rude, you can just leave, like, be like, ""Well I was gonna buy this, but now I'm leaving."". Or tell their manager they're rude and get them fired, or but you kind of meet butt heads with them. But that doesn't that happens more so like when I go to New York or not even in XXX15 so much. XXX15. But um like up in the farther north northern regions, that happens more. But I guess you just have to meet them back by being aggressive. Right. Yeah. Right. The American way. laughter O K. One more role-play to do. Now, I know that down in ur your island, or in XXX07, you probably don't have a train. Right. But ur you do in Japan. So imagine that scenario. This is a hard one, too. Kind of a <.> O K. O K? Roughly? All right. I I was. Ur. O K. Yes, sir. Can I help you? Yeah. Um uh can I pretend I'm in Europe, because this happened to me? Sure. Um I I I'm I just missed my last train to Utrecht and I have to go to Frankfurt tonight because I have to catch a plane tomorrow to fly to Thailand. And ur I just missed my last train, and there's no more today. Um is there any way but I need to get there. So I'm gonna need to take a cab or something to Utrecht to catch my train. Is there any way that I could refund ur this ticket or do something with it? Because. Well yeah. But ur sir, you've missed the train. Basically there's nothing we can do. Urm but I paid forty dollars for this train ticket, and I'm not on the train. Ur true. But that's not exactly our problem. Technically it's not, but you could try to help me out because I'm a student, laughter and I I don't have much money. And I I and I need and I need your help here. Ur true. Ur a any reason for missing this train, perhaps? Um because I was in a cab in Amsterdam, trying to catch a cab from my hostel to here. And the cab got stuck behind a behind a tram that had hit a bike, and we couldn't move anywhere for a really long time. And I should've been on time. I left with plenty of time. But the tram hit the guy on a bike. We couldn't move, and I'm here late. I've missed my train. You seem to have enough money for cabs, sir. Ur are you sure you're desperate for forty dollars? Well yeah. The cab was only three dollars. Ah I see. Uh well um well sir, this is most unusual. And and there's no way that forty dollars is gonna help you with that cab fee. Well that's true. But you could help me out. Let's be nice. The spirit of man. Come on. Urm I'm not paid to necessarily be in the spirit of man, sir. And it's my job. Ss uh ca could your can your manager authorize a refund? Well possibly, but I think it's extremely unlikely. Well we could try. What if every customer came and pleaded for the spirit of man? What if, but they don't. So can I talk to your manager? laughter Urm well you could, I guess. Urm he'll be back in a while. Ahh I suppose there's a Barnes and Noble across the street. laughter So I'm gonna go sit and read and drink some coffee while I'm waiting. You could try that, sir. I don't think you're going to get that refund, but you could try. O K. Thank you All right. I would suggest perhaps hitchhiking would be a better possibility. That is a great idea. I think I'll go hitchhike. Sounds great. I'm very sorry we can't help you with that, sir. That's fine. Thank you. O K. Thank you very much. laughter O K. Did you get your money back in ur wherever it was? No. Well it what actually happened in O K, who this is even worse. I put my bags on the train and stepped off to smoke a cigarette. The train left with my bag on it. So thankfully, almost everyone in Holland speaks English. So I ran into like the train, like line men, and asked them, ""How could I get my bag off this train? It's on its way to Utrecht, where I was supposed to catch the I C E train."". I had a Eurail pass, so it wasn't an issue of paying. But catch the train to Germany, because I had to fly to Asia. And they said that urm they said that they O K, so they called the train driver, and he told the conductor to go get the bag and let it off at Utrecht. And thankfully, I caught the next train to Utrecht, and the bag was waiting in the ticket stat in the ticket <.> All my stuff was waiting for me in Utrecht, behind the counter. But then I missed my last train to straight to Frankfurt, so I had to go to, like, wait four hours to catch a train to Koln, which is the slow train to Koln. And when I got to Koln at like midnight, all the trains in Germany were messed up for some reason and were really late, and I finally got on a train at, like, three-thirty in the morning to Frankfurt, when I should've been there at like eight at night if I had ur if I had ur caught that one little train. Or if I had not left my bag on the train and caught it to Utrecht. I see. But in the end, no problem? No, no problem. Got to Frankfurt, got to Asia, so I get. Ur. It's the American way. Yeah. laughter O K. Good stuff. Urm I'd like, next, to do a sequence of pictures with you. O K. XXX02, I'd like you to urm look at this. Now, this is a sequence of pictures going from one to six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Urm I want you to make up a story based on these pictures. Now, this happened before, so please start your story, ""One day last week"", and then O K. go. Ur let me look at it quick. The interviewee is looking at the pictures. Mm. Wait, what's happening here? laughter Well make it up. All right. Urm one day can I be I? Sure. O K. One day last week, I was driving down the street in my Mini. And ur urr I ran into a guy who was talking on his cell phone to, I think, his girlfriend urm on his motorbike. And I hit his motorbike, and busted out the back light. And he dropped his urm cell phone on the ground, and it broke, too. Urm anyway, so we had to call the police, and the policeman came. And I oh told the policeman that the reason that the guy hit me was because he was talking on his cell phone and not paying any attention to driving. Urm and the policeman agreed with me. And they confiscated his bike, or took it to the shop. But nevertheless, the guy was stuck on the side of the road, and my car <.> was not very damaged. O K. What do you think this guy did after that? Probably hitchhiked, or walked. I'm not sure where he was going, but I didn't care. I was mad at him. O K. O K. Thank you very much. Have you ever had a um interesting hitchhiking experience yourself? No, I've never hitchhiked. O K. Do you have a car back home? Yes. Well you have to, I guess. Right. In America, you have a car, yeah. . Ur what's happening to your car right now? Well my brother and sister have just turned fifteen. So they're practicing driving in it. Urm but it's other than that, it's sitting in the garage. Mm mm mm mm. I guess. What's the longest trip you've ever taken in that car? Urm guess as of now it's just to, maybe to XXX17 which is only no, to XXX08 um which is like six and a half hours away. That's how big XXX07 is. But no one realizes. But when I get back to school, I'm gonna drive thirteen hours to XXX15. which will be the longest trip. Mm mm mm. But I really like driving, so I'm kind of excited. And I've been in Japan for so long that if I never ride a train again, I'll be happy. If I always drive forever, I'll be really happy. So. laughter Any problems with that car? Urm no. Besides <.> um someone left the sunroof open one night, and but just a little bit open, and so it uu it rained in the car a little. And it didn't get the car wet or mess anything up, but it like wet the roof. And so they're like. Wow. I call it redneck roof. But like the you know, the urm cloth on the top of the roof started drooping dow excuse me, drooping down. But my I think my parents got it fixed for me while I've been in Japan. Oh I see. And the break pads needed to be fixed, too. I see. But then no no like major malfunction. Mm. Yeah. That's great. O K. Finally, we have one more story for you <.> to make up. Again, it's a sequence of pictures from one to six. I want you to make up a story. This happened before, so again, please start, ""One day last week"". This can be anybody. Ur make up names or. O K. One day last week, Suzie and urm Kara were decided to go camping. And so they packed up all their stuff and got in their car to go to Bigfoot Gorge in Alaska, to go camping. Urm they had a very nice ur orange tent which they set up. They started a fire, boiled water. Looks like they were making I think they were making um red beans and sausage. Urm and ur suddenly, ur it started raining, which it often does in Bigfoot Gorge. Urm and the wind started blowing. And ur and so they had to ur they had to ur abandon their shop because it was raining so hard. And ur they had to leave all of their things because it there were gale-force winds. Get in their car. Um it ur and they drove around until they could find a hotel. Urm by this time, it was lightning and raining even harder. They found a hotel called the Hotel Cosmos. Urm got in to spend the night, slept. Ur and when they woke up in the morning, um they had a very nice room. They sat down for some tea and coffee. Joked about the day before. Looked outside and yet, it was still raining. O K. Thank you very much. Sure. O K. Now, have you had the opportunity to travel to the countryside in Japan since you've been here? Uh yeah. We went to Uemura, which is in which is at well Ue is like a village in ur Kyushu, in Kumamoto. Kumamoto? Yeah. It was very nice. Urm I liked the countryside a lot. And we all did homestays. It was nice. O K. Not necessarily from your island, but ur in XXX07 generally, apart from XXX08, you've got a lot of rural areas there. Yes. Urm how would you compare the rural scene or the countryside scene in in a place like Kumamoto to that of XXX07? Well it's still very crowded, because the majority of the rural land is taken up by not big tracts of personal land, but big tracts of farmland. So it's just nevertheless, even though it's in the countryside, the houses are still, have very small yards compared to America. And it like you imagine the countryside, O K, so things are gonna be spacious. Among those rolling tracts of farmland, still the houses are very close together, and not as big as you would expect there to be if they're in a rural area. Because the rural parts of XXX07, the houses are huge and they're on acres of land. And there're maybe farms around, but there's still plenty of land to build your house on. But that's also because Japan is the size of California. And America is well the size of America. So Mm mm mm yeah. Well I'm always intrigued. The houses are huge, of course, the land would presumably be cheap. But the ur houses still have to be outfitted Right. beautifully. Urm if I may ask, where does the wealth come from? Ur ur I'm not familiar with the area. In XXX07? Yeah. You said the houses are huge. Well it's also not it's also urm not very expensive to build a big house in the country. Like O K, like, for example, the house I stayed inin Uemura was probably in square feet, was probably <.> maybe a thousand square feet. And they said it costs like three hundred thousand dollars to build. Now, in America, for three hundred thousand dollars in the country, you can build a six-thousand-square-foot house, which is six times the size. So like for a hundred thousand dollars, you can build a two-thousand-square-foot house, which is huge, and put it on a big tract of land, because an acre of land only costs five thousand dollars. So it's like the economies of scale in XXX07 I mean the South, there's a lot of land, and land is cheaper because it's farmland. And you may have to drive like an hour to get to your job because there's nothing around you. So it's not necessarily desirable to live there, unless, of course, you want to have a big house with a lot of land for not a lot of money. And go through the pain of commuting or whatever. Mm mm mm. So, yeah. Right. Well Five thousand dollars for an acre of land. Yeah. That's very appealing. Yeah. Yeah. But then you're in the country, so cows a abound and whatnot. You need your car and everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure. O K. We're coming to the end of the interview. Now ur XXX02, what's your schedule like for the rest of the day? We're actually going on a tour of the Diet after this. O K. Yeah. Mhm. I don't know what we're doing there, but I have to be there at one-forty. Mm. What is your actual field assignment? Uh the XXX18 which is you know, the XXX19. Mhm. And there's one in England, too, right? Urm probably. I didn't know there was one in Japan. Oh yeah. But it's got it has two people in the office. laughter You wouldn't even know that it existed. But urm yeah, so it does the same things as the it protects civil liberties. But I don't do anything. I just sit and read and read and <.> sometimes make a copy or two. Mhm mm mm mm. So, yeah. You're just sort of picking up the atmosphere. Yeah. Kind of. Mm. Any plans for the weekend? Urr no, not really. Probably go out to a bar on Friday. O K. And your mother is coming here for Christmas. Right. Um well for yeah, for no, she'll be here for the nineteenth, the twentieth, the twenty-first, and then we're going to Vietnam and Cambodia Oh. and Thailand. Spend a Yeah. lovely vacation. Yeah. Mhm. Sounds great. So it'll be nice. I'm looking forward to that. Sure. Sure. And then coming back to Japan. No. You're not. Oh that's it. Then we're going then going back to America. So you've got another month, and then that's it. Yes. Then I'm done. O K. O K. Well make sure you use your Japanese when you get back, otherwise you're gonna lose it. Yeah, I'll try. I have to take Japanese class, of course, though. Yeah. Yeah. It's just that well after you graduate, you know, you've you're gonna lose it if you don't speak it. I might come back and do JET, but Ah. just so that I can keep up my Japanese. O K. So that I can pretend that my Japanese wasn't useless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because you probably don't have much call for it Yeah. ur back in XXX07 ur XXX15 or XXX07. Right, well also when I started taking Japanese, I was under the impression, not being well educated about it then it was the eighties. And the Japan was Japanese was the language of like business in the world, which now it's Chinese, like, is the language like that most kids are taking if they're taking Asian language. It's Chinese. And I was like remembering like the talk of Japan being like the major econo I mean, it is a major economy, but still, like, as far as foreign direct investment or business goes, knowing Chinese is a little more useful, currently. But I took Japanese now, and so but also, we know English. And I think knowing English allows us to learn a language like Japanese that you can really only speak in one place. Because, like, for example, like, I was reading this article about a Thai guy and an Indian man who communicate in English. And, like, you know, they call their Mongolian partner and they all talk in English. So, like, the world communicates in English. So that can allow us to like learn Japanese Sure. or another language like that. Sure. Yeah. Sure. O K. Well I hope you have a great trip with your mother. Thank you. Thank you very much for your time today. No problem. Thank you. Thank you very much.",0
"N_file00013.txt 2002-11-14 male 20 USA 1_12m Philosophy map classroom invitation_advanced travel_advanced train_advanced car accident camping O K. Good morning. My name is XXX01. Can I have your name, please? My name is XXX02. XXX02, nice to meet you today. Nice to meet you. How are you today? I'm doing fine. O K. Have you had a good morning? Yeah. I had a pretty good morning. Hm. What did you do? Er I went to my Japanese class urm which I didn't understand too much. laughter and But that's all right. And then I had a meeting with my professor about some stuff I already did in Japanese class <.> earlier on, and he was doing some corrections for us. So. O K. Ur do you live near here? I do. I live about an hour away. I li it's. Er. That's near? laughter It's near for near for Tokyo, I guess. It's about ur it's a fifteen-minute-train-ride, and then twenty minutes' walking to the campus from the train station. And then from home from the other train station, it's about twenty minutes. So it's a good hour commute that I do every day which is sort of. Lot of walking. Good for health. Yeah, it's mm a lot of. My legs are getting stronger. So that's all right. laughter Whe where is that? Er in XXX03 XXX03 ur XXX03 City, close to the train station. Ah XXX03 XXX03 City. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. But ur that's that's a pretty big place, huh XXX03 City. It's pretty huge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's it like? I've never been there. It's urm it's kind of well I'd say it's kind of nice. But, like, the I don't really I'm not really into like big train stations or like big cities. So but urm there's er lots of stuff going on there. It's like a huge there're like, I think, ten tracks there. And there's like a big bus terminal there. Like, you come outside, and there's a big loop where all the buses are waiting there, like fourteen or fifteen stops. And then all around the place there are these huge ur like department store, you know, like Japanese department stores. Er they're super-tall and have like twenty floors of different things, electronics, something like that. So it's it's pretty but it's always full of people, like there're people everywhere. So it's it's fun, though. How did you end up in XXX03 City? Well we did urm I just sort of got assigned there by XXX04, sort of program. Then sort of like we had to fill out a sheet saying what we wanted or not what we wanted, but, like, what is it? For housing, like, there're all these, all sorts of questions that we had to answer. And then so we would ur we would just filled it out, and then they sort of assigned us with a family. And I think the family, first, was more important than the location. And so I got a set set up with a family, and then they happened to live in XXX03. So. Mm. They're close to the train station. Are you getting along well with that family? I'm getting along great. They actually lived in America for three years. They lived in XXX05. Ahh. They have four kids, which is sort of crazy sometimes. But um they're four, seven, eight and ten. Two girls and two boys. And ur they so the all the children speak English like fluently. And the father speaks English pretty well. Like, the children actually speak English without an accent at all. Sometimes, though, they they have like a Southern like ur XXX05 accent which is sort of funny. Because I'm from XXX06 so like I like I I hear Southern access accents, but I really don't have too much of a accent myself. Or at least, I think I don't. No. I'm sure to other people, No, . I do, but obviously. laughter Urm so that's kin that's kind of funny. It's also it's had to frustrating, though, because I feel like my Japanese is sort of slowed down by that. Yeah. I was thinking that. How're you gonna improve your Japanese? Right. I mean, like so I speak it's actually it's really funny. Like, I'll talk with my ur My host father my host father talks to me in English because he wants to practice English, and I talk to the kids with English because they wanna practice English as well. But urm when the host father talks to me in English, I'll respond to him in Japanese. And so it's sort of laughter it's funny because he's Japanese, speaking English, and I'm English, speaking Japa or I'm American, speaking Japanese. So it's and it's kind of funny. But it's sort o it's like we both completely understand. It's not like I'm trying to like coerce him into speaking Japanese by when he talks to me in English, responding in Japanese. Right. Right. Right. Right. But urm it's just sort of the way it works. It's just kind of funny. How did you get into Japanese in the first place? Well in high school, I studied actually, I did aikido, which is ur you know, it's a ur Japanese martial art. And I got I di I only did it for about like four or five months in high school, till the end of my senior year. And then I couldn't do it in college, because there wasn't a place close enough to me where I could study. And then urm I but I just started mm sort of thin well I get so I learned more about Japanese that way, sort of li like Japan and Japanese culture and whatnot. And then urm I um oh well lots of people lots of people at my school do study abroad. Junior year. And so I knew I wanted to go somewhere, especially like, because it's such a good opportunity just to experience like another culture and another and live in another place, and also get away from school for a little while. Urm so I started thinking about where I wanted to go. And I thought it'd be really cool to like go actually like go to Japan. And originally I just sort of just wanted to go and study aikido, which I thought would be really cool just like live in Japan and study like, my sole purpose would be just to study aikido. But urm I realized that without spe being able to speak Japanese and all, that probably wouldn't be too feasible. And and I wanna I wanna graduate on time, so I would have had to take a semester off to do that. Um so I ended up last year, my second year in college, ur I took ur Japanese all right, for the whole year. And then and then now I'm here. So. Well. O K. We have ur various tasks for you to to do this morning. Great. Ur first of all, I'd like you to look at this picture. It's a picture of a map. O K. I'd like you to describe what you can see in detail. O K. Just just describe it? Just describe it. O K. Yeah. This is good. This is good. laughter All right. Yeah. That's all right. Anything, O K. All right. Well so there's a train station in the first mm sort of in the upper I guess, northwest corner, since it's a map. Urm from the train station, there's a big road that's leading, what, sort of northwest by southeast no, northeast by southwest. laughter And ur so the close to the train station, there's a river. It's a big river that looks like it gets bigger as it goes towards the east. There is a zoo next to the train station across the road, Route Twenty-four. It's the name of the road, and it's across the road. Urm to the left of the zoo, there is there's a bank and then some offices. Urm and then if you keep on going left, there's another road called Station Way. Urm and then across Station Way, there is ur another there's a school. And there're some trees there. Urm there's also a public library if you cross Oak Street from the school. And then behind the public library, there's a hospital. Going if you were to go, let's see, well from the hospital across Station Way going to the right, there is a restaurant. And then if you kept on going to the right, and you crossed Elm Street, then you'd get to the Park View Apartments. laughter Urm there's also a supermarket that's across Park Avenue from the apartments. And then to the left of that crossing stati back over Station Way is a bookstore and a post office and a bus station. There's also whoops there're some movie theaters behind the parking lot no behind the I'm sorry, behind the supermarket. And then by the movie theater, there are bunch of houses. And if you keep on going south, you'd get int you'd run into Route Forty-four which looks like ur it's a pretty big road. And then to the South River. O K. This is the full detail on that. laughter What's your impre impression of this town? My impression of this town? It looks pretty small. It looks like it's maybe kind of boring. There's not a lot to do. You could either go eat at the restaurant or go to the movie theater. laughter Looks like there're there're some trees, which is nice, which is good to see, because a lot of towns these days are treeless or filled with super-tall buildings and whatnot. So it's nice to see some nature. laughter And then the two rivers. Urm. Mm. So yeah. O K. O K. I presume ur back in XXX06, that there are plenty of trees? Mm. Yeah. Yeah, there's a fair amount. What where is the hometown? In XXX07, XXX06. XXX07 I've heard of that. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people have heard of it. Urm what's it like? I mean wha what do people do? laughter It's a pretty boring town. It's actually I mean, XXX07 was one of the first well XXX08 was one of the in like American history, one of the first colonies established, and XXX07 is like right next to XXX08. It's like I can if I ride my bike over over the ur what's that, the lake, I'm pretty much in XXX08. Like I can get there in like ten minutes or so. Urm but and then I guess XXX07 was, what, established like sixteen fifty or something, I'm not sure exactly when. But urm and so there's I guess maybe about fifty years ago, there was a big push to I'm not exa I I'm not really sure exactly when it started, but it's ur basically it's a tourist town. And so, like, ur people um there's a big like colonial sector that's sort of kept the same way as it was, you know, like back in sixteen fifty. And so like everybody comes to visit it all the time, and, like, there're always tourists. I mean it's it's it's a tourist town. Like, there're restaurants and hotels and XXX09, it's called. For for the people who live in the real XXX07, Yeah. how how do they feel about such a thing? I personally hate it. laughter Like, I mean, I think a lot of I've always thought that it's not a great it's a good town to grow up in, like, maybe, like, from being a baby to maybe eleven or twelve. And then from twelve to from twelve maybe to thirty, it's just a not-happening town at all. And maybe like sett like when you wanna settle down, you know, like it's sort of it's sort of like a settling-down town. It's not at all a happening town, you know. So I personally, like, right now, like, I avoid it as much as possible Not the age. Right. Exactly. But I mean. Urm but how how do the locals interact with all these throngs of tourists? They interact pretty well, for the most part. Like, people would go about their daily life. Like, I mean, there are actually like a lot of people that are employed by XXX09, like, working in the shops, or like dressing up, like do interpreting, you know, like doing all kinds of stuff. And then and I guess it brings a fair amount of employment to the town. Yeah. So. sniff There's also, I should mention, in the town, a college, XXX10, which is I guess ur it's a sort of famous school, I guess. But urm at least people in XXX06 . But urm and so a lot of people work there, too. And urm like for the most part, I guess interaction with tourists is not <.> I mean, I, I guess it's sort of comes in waves, right? So, I mean, like, in the summer, like, there're lots of tourists. And like sometimes people complain about like people not knowing the way around or whatever, you know, like when you're driving. There's this great place called ""confusion corner,"" right next to XXX11. Li er it's I mean it's just really confusing. There's like a stop sign and a yield sign. And but then the people coming from but the people taking a left turn have the right of way. And so mm which is just sort of odd for, you know, an American, so, you know, there's always confusion about e especially tourists, you know, will come there and stop and not know what to do and then. Right. Ur it's bad. laughter . Right. O K. One more picture I'd like to show you. It's a picture of a classroom, actually. I'd like you to describe this in detail. Great. O K. First, there is a teacher explaining something that's on the board. It looks like some math. laughter I can tell you what it what's going on. Urm the teacher is in front of the desk. She's pointing at the blackboard, reading from a book. Urm in the background, there are students. It looks like there are six, yeah, laughter six students. And there are ur various modes of paying attention. I guess that's not very good English, is it? There there I've kind of forgotten my English. laughter I've been in Japan for too long. Urm I some people are paying attention, and some people are not. It looks like the boy with the yellow hair the blond hair in the front is paying close attention. He's taking notes. There's a girl to the right of him, or well to his left who is looks like she's E-mailing on her phone. Urm the boy to the right of him who's wearing glasses and looks very muscular urm is chewing bubble gum. He's blowing a bubble. There're two girls behind the bubble blower who are talking, and looks like they're maybe doing make-up or talking about make-up. She's maybe talking about her nails. And then there's a guy behind the the blond-haired boy who is drinking, looks like juice or something, and listening to a Walkman, and has a pencil and paper out like he's taking notes. But it looks like he's not. O K. If you were that teacher, how would you urm control that class? How would I control that class? sigh I don't know. It's actually interesting, because I I'm doing some teaching here, like, in the and I actually just talked with a Japanese professor ur not profe I mean, well a teacher in an elementary school about what she does when people aren't paying attention. And ur she said a lot of times what she'll do is find somebody like, for instance, like it's clear that the girls in the back aren't paying attention, so she would call on the girls and then ask a question and then try to get the girls in the class to answer. Urm which I I guess that's a pretty good method. It's also funny because I'm a camp counselor, too. Like I've been working at a summer camp for the past like four years. And it's really, like, it's my li like, I love to do it. And like the friends that I've made there are like some of my best friends, you know, ever, and s I'll probably be working there for a long time. Urm so I'm big into like we call it using er like a counselor voice, like a big sort of loud, like, ""Hey, everybody, listen up."". And like clapping clapping your hands I di laughter so maybe I'd probably I might do some of that, or I might just sort of let it slide and try not to let it stress me out too much that people weren't paying attention, and sort of if they aren't paying attention, then that's sort of their deal and I don't wanna stress myself out over trying to make them pay attention. Sure. Sure. Comparing that situation to your own days in high school, what what what do you think is the biggest difference? Biggest difference? Well first of all, the cell phone. We wouldn't have a cell phone laughter in class. Urm <.> I guess ur definitely in my high school, people didn't pay attention a lot. But not to this degree. Like they're I mean, there would be little small chats in the background when the teacher was talking. But like and like people would like like be chewing gum or maybe drinking. But it's much more discreet, I'd say. Like it would you know, like you wouldn't like like the guy who's blowing a bubble is like sort of staring out of the window with his like arms defiantly crossed, like, ""I'm not listening to you at all."". Like sniff people would at least sort of feign like they're paying attention, all right? Right. And like people would like sleep, but, you know, try to like prop one arm up or like, you know. Right. So they wouldn't look like they were asleep. But it's clear that they were asleep, especially when they started. laughter You know, they started falling over. O K, O K, great. Thank you very much. O K. Now, I need to do series of role-plays with you. O K. Scenarios. Ur first of all, look at this one here. It's an invitation card. I need you to read this card, sort of understand the scenario. And then when you you've got it, I'll urm I'll start. The interviewee is reading the card for a while. O K. I think I can. O K, you get the scenario? I don't know if I can do it. Let me get a better look. laughter O K. On the telephone. Hello. Hello. This is ur XXX01 here. Hey, XXX01. This is XXX02. How are you doing? XXX02. laughter Hey, look, I'm really sorry about last night. I urm I just wanna apologize to you for not showing up. I actually, I had a crazy night. It was insane. I I was driving along and all of a sudden I got this huge flat tire and the car started spinning out of control, because it's winter and it's really icy on the road. And so we ended up in a ditch, me and my wife. And ur so luckily we were unharmed and we were both wearing seat belts, so we ended up urm not getting hurt. But anyway, we had to like get out of the car, and then as soon as we got out of the car, the car caught on fire. And and then, since we were close to ur we were close to a forest, like, some of the trees caught on fire, too. laughter So luckily my wife had a cell phone and she she called the police and the fire department as soon as she could. And they were able to they came within maybe five or ten minutes. And they were able to put out the fire, which was fine. And then and then a tow truck we we called ur the police called a tow tow truck and took us out of the ur got the car out of the ditch. But ur so we were up, you know, to like four or five o'clock, fighting fires and whatnot. So ur it was really it was just sort of out of my control. And I'm sorry. I. Oh that's that's some story. Yeah. You had a cell phone. You could call the fire people, but you couldn't call us. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. In in all the confusion of the exploding car and whatnot, ur it was I just I I'd completely forgot. And. I mean we could have come and helped, you know. We would have loved to have helped. That's true. I I'm sure you would have, and I'm I'm I'm really sorry about that. I didn't think about it all the time. I guess so much adrenaline was going through me that I just didn't didn't know what to do or di I d I just didn't think about calling you. Well ur. Of course of course I always think about you. But ur laughter in that situation. Well I just don't know what to say to the guests, you know. I mean, everyone was expecting the two of you here. Yeah. What am I supposed to say to everybody? Well could you explain to them that we had some car trouble, maybe? And they may even read about it in the newspaper. laughter laughter Well yeah. That that's that's ur that's some story. That's some story. Well at least you're O K. Yeah. At least I'm O K. And listen, if if you feel like inviting me again, I would really I would really love to come. And maybe we'll put some snow tires on the car or take a bus or something, take a cab. laughter So ur laughter so things won't won't happen that way next time. O K. Will. All right. O K. You take care, then. Thank you. You take care, too. O K. Thank you very much. Wow. That's I'm so encouraged. laughter Ur from at down in XXX07, you I guess you've got to have a car. There's no trains, right? Yeah. Oh God, there's no ur I mean there there's a train that can take, you know, to ur Washington, D C or something. But it's all it's all driving or riding bikes. It's really not even I mean, you can walk, but it's non <.> I mean i it's a long walk, you know. Yeah. Like to get anywhere, is a it's a pretty big walk, I guess. Have you had a ever had any trouble with a car? Not too much trouble, actually. I've been lucky with my I drive a Honda Accord. I love that car. It's actually my mom's car. But I drove it all through high school. And ur there was some like small motor trouble here and there, but for the most part, it was fine. Like didn't have any big trouble. I know that a lot of um kids do drive to high school. Uhm yeah. to and from. It's er inconceivable in Japan, of course. Right. But Right. er or even in England, really. But the urm that idea strikes me. What happens to the student who doesn't have a car? Maybe they don't have enough money or Right. their parents wont't let them. How how do students like that feel when everybody's got the lot is filled with students' cars, Those students. and they don't have one? Yeah. The I mean <.> there's a there well there's a bus, you know, that takes you there urm if you don't have a car. And like, <..> you know, honestly, I've never talked to anybody who didn't ur it's not that I wouldn't talk to anybody who didn't have a car, but I've never talked to them about, you know, like oh ""How do you feel about riding the bus?"". Like. So there were ki I mean, i it's not like everybody had a car. Right. Right. Oh yeah. There're definitely like buses that, yeah, took people. I mean, mostly, by senior year, like <.> either, like, you had a friend who drove or you drove yourself, you know, or the something like that. So you di most seniors didn't ride the bus. Or yo or you live close enough to school that you could just walk there in the morning, or you could walk you know, walk to a friend's house or something. Urm but I and I guess, like, the thing about riding the bus was sort of like not not a stigma definitely, but like <.> like I hated riding the bus. Like for most people like hated riding the bus. Like they really like it's sort of like it's something that you do if you have to, but like most people hate it. Urm so I guess the people who rode the bus like weren't too thrilled about riding the bus. And maybe like sort of oh not envious, but like wanted maybe wanted to drive. But. Ur. That stigma that you mentioned, that's that's an economic thing? I like not so not so much, I don't think. Like me, personally, I didn't like riding the bus because admit that I wasn't independent. You know, like Ah. being able to I mean, it's sort of like like you ride the bus in elementary school and middle school. I mean, like, you have to. But then like once you get to high school, like, you know, you like freshman year, fifteen, like you know what's going on in the world, you know. Like you're growing facial hair or you're you know, you've got a girlfriend. Like laughter like you wanna be independent, you know or at least, I did. You know, I was like that time. I shouldn't speak for everybody. But urm so like definitely riding the bus, like personally, I didn't like it. I definitely didn't stigmatize other people who rode the bus. No, no. You know, I wasn't like, ""Oh they're a bus rider."". You know, like ur ""He's a car driver."". I mean ur I guess I never really in my mind, never really made that distinction between like people driving, people riding the bus. You know what I mean? Like. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Nice . Yeah. O K. Another one. Urm a different scenario, traveling scenario, if you could read through that. The interviewee is reading the card. Should I be angry? Uh should I? O K. Just ur I wan I want to. O K. Good morning, sir. Can I how can I help you? Yeah. Well I wanted to talk to you about the Florida Keys getaway trip that ur we my wife and I went on. It's a wonderful trip. Well actually, er it looked like it was a wonderful trip, but I really have to disagree with you. Urm apparently, the Florida Keys that you were talking about are the different Keys than ur than I know. And ur cough we actually ended up staying with the Key family in Florida. laughter Urm we got we the the the air the airplane trip was fine. We got there urm with without without any trou trouble at all. But ur then we came and ur the taxi ur the the the limousine driver was waiting there, like they said. But then ur as soon as we got into the car, it was this old busted-up Chevy and we had to ride in the back. It was a truck, and we had to ride in the back. And then we went and we drove to down to the ur swamp, and we stayed with the Key family for a week. Which is part of our um enjoying the F cultural heritage of Florida program. Mm-hm. I see. But I think that there is a little discrepancy in what actually happened and what you ur proposed to happen. For instance, the pool the ur luxurious swimming pool that was guaranteed and the hot tub right next to it was actually a swamp and a ur a small a small tub filled with hot water urm which I could barely fit in myself. Urm the Key family was a lovely family. I I I really enjoyed spending time with them. And we invited them back up to XXX06 maybe. But ur this this was horrible, and I I mean, I think this is just outright lying that you did on your brochure. And I want a full refund. And I'm very seriously considering calling my lawyer and having him ur talk to you guys about. But we don't need to go that far, I'm sure, sir. Well you know, ur could you ur recompensate me could you pay me back for ur what happened during the trip? I got a. Ur well urr er it does say in the brochure, sir, that unfortunately, refunds are not permitted in this program. Mhm. Well that's really interesting. We really don't have any complaints for from the Key family. Yeah. People stay with the Key family. Yeah. They love it. Huh well. Quite an experience. Well you know what, you know maybe. The real Florida. Right. The real Florida. Yeah. It's ur that's a bunch of crap. And ur I think I may schedule another appointment you, like with you ur with and bring my lawyer along with me. Well yeah. You don't really want to go that far, sir. And ur so. I I let me have a word with my manager. O K. I'm sure we can sort something out. O K. Yeah. That'd be great. That'd be really great. O K, thank you very much. O K. I wonder if there really is a Key family. laughter There probably is. Right. Right, down in Miami somewhere. Mister and Mrs Key. Right. I'm sure, yeah, Mister and Mrs Key. Urm you've t you've traveled anywhere except for Japan? Urm not out of the U S This is my first time. First time. Yeah. What was your first impression when you got to got to Tokyo? Oh man. It's crazy, like, well we ended up well we came to Narita Airport. Urm and got like I mean I'd been like I've been er sort of like all up and down the East Coast. And I've been to California, like, when I was really young. So I've done some like airplane flying. And I actually went to Jamaica when I was like maybe twelve, like in fifth grade. Urm but like this is this is the first time it was the first time in maybe, God, like ten years that I've done that no, less than that, like five, six years that I've done like a big, big trip, you know. And so like two, three nights before, like, I started not being able to sleep. And I probably got like like the third day or three days before, right? How do you say that in English? Like <.> all right, I left on I feel like my English skills are going down the tubes. I left on, when did we leave, a Sunday. Friday night, I couldn't sleep er well Thursday night, I slept maybe like four hours. Friday night, I slept maybe like three hours, four hours. And then Saturday night, I slept like one hour - like, I couldn't sleep at all. But I I got here well on the on the plane, I was I was just so excited about it like and like nervous and, you know, and just all these emotions like just mixing up just like not not even making me not being able to sleep. And ur so I got here, and I just had this stupid, like, shit-eating grin on my face. Like I hadn't slept I probably hadn't slept in like by the time we got to the hotel and I finally went to bed, it was like maybe thirty-six hours, maybe like thirty hours, something like that, without sleeping. And ur but like the whole time I got here, like I just had this huge grin on my face, and I was just so excited to be here. Urm I mean, like, that definitely probably wore off, though. laughter . Right. I mean like I guess laughter like people talk about like the whole like adjusting to a different culture and whatnot. And like like I mean, so it was great like the first week was really exciting. Like I was like, ""Yeah, this is awesome. I'm here."". Like it was hard you know, like, when you're hard being away from home, but like still super-exciting. And like definitely like lonely at times, like I went I was working at that summer camp that I had talked to you about before, and like like some of my best friends, you know, like so I was hang out with them all summer, and then, like, you gotta completely cut off and like just be completely on my own, you know. It's kind of hard. And tha and that sort of like maybe after a couple of weeks, sort of like got more and more apparent, you know, and like. O K. One more role-play. All right. So, go ahead. Mm. Urm this is a very Japanese scenario, rather than laughter XXX06 scenario. But ur if you could imagine this scenario. laughter A XXX06 . The interviewee is reading the card out loud. O K. I'm terrible at whining. So laughter . O K, O K, we still have to. Urm yeah. Good morning, sir. cough How how may I help you? Good morning. Well funny thing happened to me on the way to the train today. I got held up. There was an old woman and I was helping her cross the street. Urm she was very old, very I just I just you know, I thought it was my duty as a human being to sort of help her cross the street. Well anyway, I'm sure you're not interested in that. What ended up happening was that I missed the train going to Washington, D C. Urm and I was wondering if it was at all possible for me to get a refund or maybe get the ticket changed for another time. Urr well ur you're aware, sir, that basically we have a policy against refunds. Right. I realize that. But I was wondering maybe, you know, I was helping this old lady, like <.> I myself, I'm a priest. Urm and I was actually going to a convention to talk about world peace. Urm just wondering if maybe out of the good the kindness in your heart, I mean, I realize it sort of goes against company policies and I don't wanna force you to do anything you don't wanna do. But ur I was wondering maybe just sort of as a, you know, friend to friend ur sort of thing that maybe you'll be able to. I'd love to be your friend, sir, but unfortunately, I'm not paid to to be the kindest person and well I'm paid to do my job. laughter Right. Mm. Well I understand. Maybe. The little old lady across the road, I've I've heard that a few times. Well. Have you? Have you found Jesus? laughter I'm afraid I have not, sir. And it's not gonna help with that refund I'm afraid. laughter Well is there laughter is there any way that maybe we could change my ticket to ur maybe I could catch the next train? I see on the schedule there's a train leaving at twelve o'clock, and it's nine-thirty right now. So. Ur ur you could do that, sir, but ur it's only that's nineteen dollars fifty for a ticket. I'm sure Right. you could manage that. But the thing is I mean, I understand about there're no refunds. I I I think I can accept that. But ur the thing is that I paid for a ticket to D C, and urm though I missed the train, it's I still haven't been to D C on this ticket. So I feel like it's perfectly fine for you to give me the ticket. . Well I I do understand, sir. But you paid for a specific ticket. Mm. . Uh the ticket that goes to D C. Urm the ticket that left ten minutes ago. Oh. The train left ten minutes ago. I see. I. Put yourself in my shoes. What would you do, sir? Right. Well I would I mean I s I I I see your situation. And ur wonder why you work for such a horrible company. But I ur laughter I urm well I mean, I guess there are rules that you have to follow for your company, and that if. Let me speak to a manager, sir. O K. Well thank you very much. Let me speak to a manager, and, I mean, being that you are a man of the cloth, laughter um we'll see if some arrangement can be made. Well thank you very much. . O K, thank you very much. Let's pray. laughter O K. Thank you very much. That's the end. Thank you. Ur how how how do you find the trains here? I mean, everybody talked about the trains. Oh man. They they're crazy. Like I I mean, like l was saying before, I'm not I'm not big into big cities at all. And like <.> going like all right I go to school like outside of XXX12. I mean, like twenty minutes outside of XXX12. And er the trains around there are are like I like, and coming into XXX12, I like. XXX12 is a very like nice city. You know, it's not I I think it's like a very friendly city, and like sort of clean and just like good places to see, I don't know, like. But cough going to XXX13, like, I assume I've I've my ex-girlfriend lived in XXX13, and I would take trains up there sometimes last year. And as soon as I got off into XXX14 Station, like, I would immediately like tense up and just like feel so dirty and so, like, ""Ugh."". Just like and hate just like the idea of just so many people being around me and just like so much indifference, you know, like people towards other people, like just really I was just li like not disgusted by, but just sort of put off by, you know, like I just didn't wanna be in that situation. So laughter here, like uh like I like maybe I thought ur the same thing would happen. But I'm sort of so removed from it, you know, like being a foreigner, that <.> being I mean, like, it's definitely still crazy and like would like definitely like maybe make me like really tense and not like it. But I just sort of like, for the most part, tend to laugh it off. Like like XXX15 Station at eight o'clock in the morning, like I go to I I do ur urm I work at a elementary school every Wednesday. And it's crazy, and it's it's like teeming with people and, you know, like people are everywhere just like packed around you. And like sometimes if I'm really tired or like not awake enough, like it just sort of like makes me angry, you know, or whatever, just so many people, so much stuff going on. But ur like for the most part, I just sort of like laugh it off, and like it's kind of fun. And sometimes it's kind of fun like just mo trying to move around all the people and stuff and like laughter like, you know, when you're both like going to the same direction and like trying to like go around the other person, it's kind of fun. But it's sort of like I have to force myself to kind of get into it. You know, just be like, ""All right, no, this can be fun,"" rather than like, ""This sucks. Like there's so many people here ."" Right, right. I understand. laughter Yeah. O K. Here's a sequence of pictures, XXX02. Well this time I'd like you, I'd like you to make up a story from these pictures Great. going from one to six. O K. So base the story on these pictures. Er this happened before, so please start the story, ""One day last week"", O K. and then go. All right. So one day last week, cough I was driving in my car, just driving the car like I normally do, going to work. And ur cough I was taking a turn I was making a turn. And there was this guy on a motorcycle on a scooter, actually. He was on a scooter, and he was all talking on his phone, all dangerously driving the scooter with one hand, chitchatting away. Luckily, he was wearing a helmet, so that was that was nice. Urm but as I was taking a turn, he just completely didn't see me and he went away went ahead. And though I had the right of way, I ended up bumping into him. Well he ended up dropping the cell phone that he was talking on, since he was talking on it so dangerously. And it fell and it broke. And this guy had the audacity to ask me to pay for his cell phone. And as well no, I'm sorry. Oh God. laughter Can I start over? laughter No, no. That's O K. O K. O K. Well O K. laughter And this guy got angry at me for running into his car. Well so we called the police, of course. The police ended up coming. And ur I explained to the the police that he was talking on the cell phone and that it was his fault, and that he shouldn't have been talking. Urm and the policeman took down the information. And so, since this was just last week, the court date and stuff is still pending and whatnot. But ur his car his motorcycle ended up getting taken aw towed away. And ur I drove ur back on my way. And so the court the court date is sometime ur next month. O K, O K, thank you very much, thank you very much. All right. I'm sorry. laughter Now, may I ask, what is your car doing right now? My the car that I used to drive? The the wonderful Honda. Oh that's your mother's. But. Right. Right. It's my mom's, so she's driving it. So you don't have your own car? Right. I don't have my own car. Do you hope to? Someday. Depending on where I live. Yeah. Like I yeah. I I'd like have my own car someday. Uh uh at college right now, you don't really need a car. Uh yeah. I don't really need it. It it it would be nice. But I have friends who drive cars so, and like you said, I can take the train into XXX12 so like and I have a bike there, so, like, it's not <.> it's not needed. It's definitely not needed. In that area. Right. I mean, it'd be nice I mean it wouldn't I don't think it'd be a burden to have it, but it's not I don't really need it too much. Right. So. Right. O K. One more picture sequence I'd like you to do. Ur kind of, uh your expertise, huh for the camping captain. No, great. Urm a se again, a sequence of pictures, one to six. Make up a story. It happened before, so please start, O K. ""One day last week"", and so forth. O K. I'll look this one over more carefully before I start. So cough let's see. One day last week, my two friends ur decided to go camping. And ur they packed up all their stuff. They had all the, you know, the right equipment. I mean mm they had a tent, they had backpacks filled with flashlights and food or they they they brought some food with them, and they had cooking stuff and stuff to start a fire. And they had everything. And it was great. And so they went out to the mountains, and they pitched their tent close to a river. And ur they set up the tent great and everything everything was going really great for them. Urm they were cooking some food. But right right before they started to eat, ur it started to rain a little bit. Urm and so they got a little bit worried, but it was O K. It was it was fine. They kept on cooking their dinner, and maybe had about five minutes left urm until it was done, and their you know, they had their tent, you know, so everything was gonna be fine. Of course, it rains when you're when you're camping, so it's no big deal. They were prepared, like I said. But then cough the rain started getting stronger and stronger. So they went into the tent. And they ur they brought the food in and they started eating it. But ur then the wind picked up and it and there were gale-force winds. And ur they had to the tent actually was blown away by the wind, and ur along with it, all their stuff. And ur so they had they ran to the car, and luckily they didn't get hurt urm with all the stuff blowing away. But, so they got in the car, and they drove. And it was so bad the driving was so bad that they were they were gonna just go back home but ur the driving was so bad that they went to a or it's so unsafe to drive all the way back home that they went to the closest hotel, which was a really nice hotel. And ur so they pitched over the money to stay in this really nice hotel. And then they dried off, took showers and had a great view of the mountain. O K, . Ah yeah. What you your your camp Mm. that you run, ur what age are the kids? They're nine to fourteen. Oh that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. So it's. Er. Before they become horrible. Right. Exactly. laughter Well well they're on their way to becoming horrible, I guess. these uh thirteen-fourteen-year-olds, . Right, right, right. laughter laughter And you're gonna do that next year? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Like I've been I went there as a camper. I went there for three years. You can go, I guess, six years, what nine to fourteen. But I went there from eleven to fourteen. And then after that, I did this two-year thing that's sort of part it's a different program, but it's run by the same organization. And it's like a you can do it for two years. It's called ""Teen Adventure."". It's like a three three-week hiking, canoeing trip that you just go out and like it's sort of focused on like leadership skills and whatnot. And ur and then I was in sort of like counselor training. And so then I applied to be a counselor four years ago. And I just finished my fourth year this summer. And. Er. That's great. Yeah. It's I've I absolutely love it. Like, it's it's such a good part of my life. I'm so happy it 's exists for me. laughter Sure. Well. O K. Well we're nearly at the end of the interview now, XXX02. Really? Urm what are your plans for the rest of the day? I'm actually going to the Edo Tokyo urm Museum in Ryogoku. I'm gonna Wow. do some cough we went there before with my history class, but I'm gonna do some more research O K. O K. there. We have to write a final paper for the history class. So I'm going there. . Yeah. I live real near there. Oh do you? . I don't live there Oh yeah. I do live near there. It's nice. It's pretty ni it's big. It's like seven floors, I think, something like that. They've got this whole like Edo part where you can like sort of walk through and it takes you through like the history of Edo. It's really interesting. It's cool. O K. Well thank you very, very much for your time. Sure. Thank you. And very nice talking to you. Yeah, you, too. Thank you very much. Sure. O K.",0
"N_file00014.txt 2002-11-14 female 21 USA 1_12m Industrial Engineering classroom restaurant landlord_advanced travel_advanced shopping_advanced train station car accident My name is XXX01. Can I have your name, please? XXX02. Can I call you XXX02? Yes. That's good. O K. How are you today, XXX02? Good. Doing well. O K. Have you had lunch? Yes. I just ate. What did you have for lunch? I had obento that my host mom made me. Wow. So I had some bread with peanut cream and then some more bread with cream cheese, some pudding and orange, and I had iced tea. She makes you that every day? Well it's different every day. Oh and salad, too. But yeah. No, what I mean is she makes you a a bento every day? Oh lunch. Every day. Yeah. That's amazing. She's really sweet. laughter That's totally amazing. She's really sweet. I see. Er whe where are the host family? Where do you live? I live in XXX03, which is well it's really not that far from here. It's like in twenty-minute drive if you go by car. O K. And erm by trains and walking to and from stations, it takes about forty-five minutes at the best. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. So. So that's how you get there I mean your host mom doesn't bring you here by car. No. I usually yeah, more often almost always I take the train. O K. Yeah. sniff And what do you do here usually? Erm I'm studying here, and I'm taking some classes. And then on Wednesdays, I do field placement at er XXX04, sniff which is a company they that produces semiconductor equipment. What do you do at XXX04? At XXX04? Er not so much, actually. I spend a lot of time in front of the computer or in meetings. Erm my my function, actually, is to update XXX05 documentation. But it's a really slow process, and a lot of the times I just spend um cutting and pasting Word documents or reformatting. Erm otherwise, I talk to other people in the company and surf the Web and so on. laughter From a from the program's point of view, what's the point of you being there? Erm from the program's point of view, I'm s it's actually erm part of one of my classes. I'm supposed to be a participant observer and go there and make like anthropological observations about how people interact and how they communicate. And I'm I have my own goals to like I wanna study how people interact with their managers, or how is it different from working at this at a company in the United States, and trying to note similarities and differences between those. Then eventually I'll write erm I'll prepare like a booklet or, I guess, write a report that'll have other papers and reflections from when I was working there throughout the semester. Hmm. And what have you noticed so far about the anthropological interactions? Oh. Well I think sometimes it's really hard, because it's kind of boring. But other one of the most interesting things I've noticed is that people have well they do a lot of they interact a lot with the company in the U S, which is in erm XXX06 or in XXX07. And I've noticed that a lot of times they have a really hard time communicating, because the American people just assume that the Japanese people know English, and the Japanese people don't really understand it that well. And they have a hard time communicating or expressing their own ideas in English. And so there's a lot of communication breakdown, or like even in the meetings, sometimes they seem to go around in circles and Hm. Hm. without any any conclusions are drawn by the end of the meeting. Well. Hm. Hm. O K. Apart from apart from the program here, Hm. how have you been enjoying your free time? My free time. Oh I've been doing well I was earlier, I was taking a lot of trips, like, when we had holidays. Like, I went to Kyoto and Nara with my host sisters. Erm but a lot of times, I'll just end up taking day trips, like to Ueno or into Tokyo or erm Kamakura, various places that are outside of the city that I can go in the day and be back. What places I wen. uh appeal to you now so far? Erm actually, I went to Ueno and I really liked that, because I went to the museums. And then I'm planning on going again this weekend with my host sister. And there's a exhibit there that I really wanna see. So I really liked Ueno. I like Kamakura. Erm I had a good time in Kyoto, actually, when we went there, too. I guess it's not only a day trip, but it was really nice erm to see a different part of Japan and the landscape. So the more historical type places. Er I think so. Yeah. Hm. For the most part. I ha don I haven't really had opportunity that much to experience the nightlife, because we live a little bit far from the city. And then you can't stay out too late because, like, the trains will shut down and whatnot. So I haven' I haven't really gone out at night that much. How old are these er sisters? My host sisters are twenty-one and twenty-three. And so, yeah, we get along really well. Hmm. Hm. What what differences do you notice between, for example, yourself, Mh-hmm. you're what, twenty-one? Mh-hmm. And the twenty-one-year-old Japanese girl? Erm actually I think I think maybe, as far as what we like to do, we're we're a lot alike. Erm a lot of the differences maybe just center around the family life. Like, I haven't lived at home for almost well more than three years now. And so it's it's kind of strange to see how like how she interacts with her mom and like how she's still living at home or she actually I think she will be living at home for a while still. And so it's interesting to see like how she interacts with her family, whereas when I go home, it's usually just for the weekend or maybe, at the most, like two and a half or three weeks for a Christmas vacation. And so erm it's good. But I think like as far as maybe her relationship with her friends or going out with her friends and having fun, you know, she does a lot of the same things, probably. Or just removed in place, but, Hm. you know, like, similar activities. All right. Well makes sense. Yeah. O K. First of all, I'd like to show you a a a picture. We have s various tasks that we have to do. Mh-hmm. I'd like to show you a picture. Mh-hmm. Er could you describe this picture in detail, please? O K. Erm. The interviewee is looking at the picture. Looks like in this in this sketch, there's a math teacher who's trying to describe some sort of algebra concept to her class. It is probably looks like maybe a sixth- or seventh- grade class, and she's having a difficult time keeping the attention of the students. One person is chewing gum. Another person is talking on her cell phone or sending messages on her cell phone. Another person is drinking, and two girls are talking. One is doing her nails. Erm sigh well there is like one student that's looking up at the chalkboard and he looks thoroughly confused. And the teacher seems completely unaware that the students er have no interest at all whatsoever in what's going on in the class. Erm maybe, it looks a little bit possi possibly, like an actual junior high classroom. But a little bit a little bit exaggerated. Er I think most students wouldn't be so blatant about their their, I guess their obvious disrespect to the teacher, but it's erm maybe maybe an exaggeration, a little bit. But. O K. If you were this teacher, Uh-huh. how would you try to get their attention? Oh wow. Erm I think sigh I don't know anything about teaching, but I think a lot of times one of my teachers, what he would do, when I was in high school, was he would just stop talking. And then once the students realized that that he wasn't teaching, then they'd then they'd stop listening and Hm. I mean, then they'd stop performing the other activities and look up and wonder why the teacher wasn't teaching. But I don I don't know. I guess you could yell, too. laughter laughter Maybe that's not the most constructive constructive method. O K. Generally speaking, Yes. what was the atmosphere like in your high school? In my high school? Yeah. Erm the atmosphere is really it was really interesting in high school because we had two programs. We had a a magnet program, then we had the regular students or the grade school students. And erm my high school was <.> kind of in the ghetto. And so we didn' we didn't usually have like the magnet students that came from all over the city didn't usually have the students with the home school students that went there. And so the atmosphere is is really different. Like in the classroom, all most of the time the students were fairly attentive. Classes were small. And erm it it would usually be, usually productive class, I think. Erm if you went out in the hallway during passing periods, it was totally different. Erm students are really rowdy. Every now and then you'd been in class, and like someone would just go around yelling in the hallways. You don't know what he or she was saying. Er it was really it was really interesting. It was very intercultural, I guess. Yeah, with with one er set of students here and a totally different set of students here, Mh-hmm. er wa wa wasn't there any friction between these two groups of people? Er. <.> Some stigmatizing relations between the two? I don't I think s I think maybe there was some friction. I think a lot of times, the <.> like the the staff or the well the faculty would try not to erm give exclusive rights to one group or the other. But maybe erm maybe like s lo some of the magnet kids might have oh may s some of the grader school kids might have earned the resentment of the magnet kids because perhaps like the magnet students couldn't couldn't perform an activity because it would be unfair if the grade school students couldn't, or er maybe the grade school students felt resentful towards the magnet school students because they felt like the magnet students got more rights because they're more productive in class, or they might take another field trip that they didn't, or something along those lines. sniff Hm. O K. O K. Great. One more picture I'd like you to describe for me. It's a picture of a restaurant. Mh-hmm. If you could describe this in detail. O K. Erm in this picture, it looks like there's a man and a woman out on a date. A waiter is is coming by with a cart and he is presenting them with some <.> with some wine. It looks like the man is looks like he's probably gonna taste the wine and then go ahead and go ahead and tell the waiter whether he wants to continue drinking it and pour some for his date or not. And it's probably a pretty nice restaurant. In the back, there's playin there's someone playing the piano. And it's around dinnertime. It's seven o'clock. And there are some other nicely dressed couples in the background. Er pretty much the same situation. Nothing nothing extraordinary. Er looks like they're just enjoying a pleasant evening out. O K. Have you been to a a a nice, fancy restaurant in Japan at all? Oh no. Not in Japan. Hm. Hmm. Where do you usually eat if yo er except with your host family, of course? Erm. sigh Wow. Erm don't really go out that much. Usually if I I've been out with the friends a couple of times. And we'll just go to a nearby restaurant. If for lunch, like we'll just stop at any place and eat. Just really small restaurants. For dinner, er one time I went with one of my host sisters to to a bar for a going-away party for her friends. And I think er we just went out and we drank and ate a lot. And it was probably just like any other Japanese small restaurant. It wasn' actually, I didn't even think it was a bar, it was more like a restaurant. And we went there. Erm. How was that different from a restaurant like this? Oh that. It was different. Well we sat on excuse me, we sat like we sat underneath the table well not underneath the table, but the the table was er lower. And so i I don't know how else to explain it. Erm and we it was an Asian atmosphere. A lot of the food was different. It wasn't it wasn't really nice. Like it was just it was a very casual place. And the place in the picture looks like it's actually a kind of a formal place where people might go to eat on a on a really nice evening for some special occasion. Hm. O K. XXX02, if I may ask, how did you get interested in Japan, Japanese in the first place? Erm I am an engineering major. And I got I got really tired of just taking engineering classes over and over. And so I wanted to take a class where I could learn something and also be interested in it, and just take a class because I wanted to learn, and not because I had to take it for a requirement. And I didn't wanna worry about what kind of grade I grade I wa grade I would earn. I just wanted to go and learn something. And so I thought a foreign language would be a really good way to do that. And I decided that Japanese would be Japanese would be a good language, because maybe if I wanted to pursue a career in business or erm something along those lines, then Japanese might prove to be very useful in that way. I see. O K. Great. O K. I'd like to do a series of role-plays with you. O K. Erm first of all, this one here. If you could just read this to yourself, this is a scenario. I want you to figure that out. O K. Then I'll play the part. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? I'm gonna be the building manager. O K. O K. Er ring-ring. Er ring. Hello? This is XXX01 here. Hi, this is XXX02 in A-one. Ah XXX02. How are you? I'm doing fine. Er I have kind of a problem with my apartment. I came home Oh? from classes today and the the window in my bedroom is broken. Wow. And. That's something. Er yeah. Do you think you could fix it sometime soon? Er it just broke? Well I came home from classes. I don't know if somebody threw something at it or er if there was some crack beforehand and nobody really noticed. But I I don't know how it happened. It's just broken. laughter O K. Erm I'm kind of busy right now. O K. Well uh can you give me some sort of date, like possibly tomorrow or later today or hopefully by the end of the week, because it is kind of cold outside. Well I'm a bit tied up. I mean, and it's not that cold. Well it is it is really cold at night, actually. And so I wouldn't I wouldn't want to have any problems because it's too cold at night. Well you could er how about some taping? Maybe er you could pu put a magazine over the hole or something like that. I can drop off some brown tape, maybe? Well that's a that's a great temporary solution. But er I think you are you should be obligated to fix this window sometime soon. Erm I would love to. You know, it's just er Sunday, maybe? Sunday. Oh what's today? Tue Tuesday? Thursday. Today's Thursday? Friday, Saturday. Do you think you could come on Saturday? I'm busy on Sunday. Erm I guess it's possible. Erm I'm not sure about the time. O K. Erm hm should I call you I think Sunday should probably be O K. Erm are you gonna call me back or should I should I call you to make sure? Yeah, er I don't mind calling you back. Erm no problem at all. O K. All right. I might have to bill you for it, though. I mean, it's not like it's our responsibility or anything. Well <.> er I understand. But it's also <.> it's also not my fault, either. So I don't understand how you could bill me for it, possibly. It's not like I broke the window. Well it's not like I broke the window either. Erm O K. Well let's talk about that on Sunday. Yeah, def we can talk about that. Or er maybe I might call the er <.> the , er people who own the apartment and I might talk to them, too, about it. Erm well you probably won't need to go that far. O K. I'm sure I can arrange something. O K. Thank you. O K. Thank you very much. Bye. O K. Thank you. Bye-bye. That's the end of the role-play. Now, er you said you haven't lived, uh three three years uh at home. So you've been living at college. Right. Where is college? XXX08 in XXX09. In XXX09. Mh-hmm. O K. And whe Or just north of XXX09, actually. And where is home? XXX10 well XXX11, XXX12. Wow. That's a that's a long way. It is far. Yeah. That's a long way. laughter And at up in XXX09 there, you have a a an apartment, or you live uh on campus? Erm my first two years, I lived on campus. And then last year, I lived in apartment with friends. Mh-hmm. O K. Erm what sort of difficulties are there in that apartment? Have you had any problems there? Er yeah. We did have some problems. Like, I think maybe the space was too small. There were four girls and it was three-bedroom apartment. And then in the this was in the fall quarter. And then in the winter quarter, we had five girls. And so it was it was really crowded. Erm a lot of times we had just problems with like who was obligated to take care of what. Especially there was one girl that like never did her dishes. Er and so like one of my other roommates would always get upset about her lack of tidiness. And er we had sometimes we had some hard times just like figuring out who was responsible for buying the next roll of toilet paper or if or if er garbage bags running out, who was responsible for buying this and that. I would have problems with er noise at night, because I like to go to bed earlier. And so sometimes that would irritate me. But on the on the whole, it was sniff it was O K, I think. It was well maybe it was just more like tolerable, because I knew it was temporary and not permanent. But sniff it was er it was it was interesting. I mean, it was fun, because they were my friends, too. Right. And so it was nice to be around with them. Right. What's the biggest difference between living in an apartment and, uh campus life? Oh. Erm. I guess it's a big change. I guess. It might have been more different had I lived really far from campus. But I lived really close to campus. Erm maybe one of the differences is that it's possibly slightly less convenient. Like, I wouldn't go back to my apartment in between classes. I just learned to stay on campus during the day. Um living living on campus was difficult, because you have to you don't have your own space, really. You have to I was I would live with someone else when I was on campus. And anywhere you go, there is always people around, and you never have a place where you can go just for yourself, really, just if I wanted to study or anything. And then Hm. when I was living in the apartment, it was nice to have that. I can go to my own room and study there and have some alone time. O K. Great. Thanks. O K. Next up, I'd like you to read this one. It's a travel scenario. O K. O K. If you could just read that one to yourself. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K. Erm yes. Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you? Hi. Er my name is XXX02. And I went on your er luxury tour er this past week through through the Northeast. And I have some problems with it. And I was wondering if there was someone I could talk to. Sure. Which tour was that? This was the er the Luxury Luxury Tour through the Northeast. That was the name of the tour. Yes. Yes. Er I think I'm familiar with that tour. Erm well I was expecting I whe when I booked the when I booked the er when I booked the trip, I was expecting to be guided on this er fantastic bus tour, and we had expected that everything would be taken care of, like meals, and the bus er bus was supposed to be very comfortable, and I'm afraid that it wasn't at all. And so I was wondering if if there was any type of compensation I could receive for this. Well what do you mean it wasn't comfortable? I'm sure. Well erm like the driver wasn't friendly, and it was, like, the temperature was always uncomfortable. We asked him several times if we could open the windows or if he could turn up the A C. And he just he wa pretty much did everything except for refuse. Erm. laughter We. Er. Ah I'm sorry about that. The unfortunately, the the the driver works for the bus company. We we only have a contract with that company. We can't control the driver. Well when you when you guarantee to your customers that the trip is supposed to be a luxurious one, I assume that you look into these types of factors before. We we do er choose the best company, of course. We can't go down to the level of the individual. Well have you has anyone from your company ever actually been on this type of trip? Erm we've researched it. Well I should I would think that before you go around making promises to your customers that you would you would do more than research it. Especially if if your relationship with your customer is going to be on the line for it. Well I do understand that. Erm but we only have a problem of a of a of a nasty individual. The the trip itself was wonderful, right? Well actually, a lot of the stops, erm we felt really rushed. Erm they promised us that we would have time to look around and all and do other types of activities. But we didn't really have that much time. We spent a lot more time on the bus than we'd expected. It's traffic, you know. And nobody can control the traffic. No. I don't I really don't think there was that much traffic. Erm it was just that, you know, I think I feel like they tried to take us to too many things and it wasn't it was not exactly what what we had anticipated, or it wasn't exactly how you had portrayed it to be um when we had talked to talked to your representative about this. Hmm. O K, madam. I I will certainly look into it. O K. And I'll get back to you. And hopefully, we can come to some sort of arrangement. O K. Thank you. Thank you very much, O K, great. laughter O K, XXX02, is this the first time you've been outside the States? No. No, it's not. Where have you been? Er I've been to well my family travels a lot. Actually, I've I've been to India several times because I have have family there. And then Oh O K. erm we've also been to like Canada and Mexico for brief brief brief periods of time. And then I also went to Germany with my family, and spent some time in Italy, too, with one of my friends. Hmm. With friends? Mh-hmm. How was that Italian trip? What did you do? Er it was fine. It was just me and one of my best friends. And we went after our senior year, and we spent four weeks there just traveling around. We just had backpacks. I mean, I we can't really say we were backpacking, because we didn't just spend the night anywhere. But erm it was really fun because there were just two of us and we could make decisions easily and Hm. er just enjoy the countryside. What did you end up doing? Wow. We went we went to a lot of places. We would go like every two or three days, we were going to different places. We went to I think Rome and Rome and Venice and Assisi. And we just we tried to do a lot. But we spent a lot of time walking, too, and eating, trying out the food. Just, it was a good time. O K. Great. O K. One more thing I'd like to to do with you. It's a shopping scenario. This is the last one. If you'd like to have a look at that. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? O K. Yes. Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you? Hi. I just bought this I just bought this shirt. And when I got home, I realized that it was the wrong er er I just realized that it was the wrong size. I was wondering if I could exchange it for something else. Well basically, er we d we do have a policy against er exchanges or refunds. Er is there anything you can do? I mean you know I just bought it. You can see the receipt that I and there's no way I would've even had any time to wear it or anything. Right. I'm just wondering you didn uh you knew your size when you bought it, right? Well yes. But I wasn't I was kind of in a rush and I didn't realize that it wouldn't fit. Mhm. I mean, not all the clothes are made exactly the same size. Erm which is why we have fitting rooms, of course. Well I'm s I'm sorry, I didn't really have that much time. Erm could you make an exception just this once? Just for you? Please? laughter Well that's very difficult, because what if all of our customers said the same thing? You know, it's extra paperwork. Extra administration. Well I understand. But it wo I would really, really appreciate it. I mean it you can see it's exactly the same as when I bought it. It would mean a lot to me. Please. laughter Well put yourself in in my shoes. Um I have a job to do. O K. Well I understand. Thank you. Er perhaps you could talk to my manager. Erm yeah. That would be good. Do you think that's possible? I think so. Maybe erm ""Please"" is probably not good enough. I mean maybe if you try to maybe exchange it for something exactly the same? Oh yeah. That would be great. Different size? If I could exchange it for a better size, that would work out perfectly. Same color, same material. Oh yeah. That would that would be great, actually. O K. Well he's gonna come back soon. So O K. and have a word with him. Erm I'll just go browse around. Shall I just come back in about couple minutes? Yeah. Maybe you have a look for something the same size. O K. That sounds good. O K. Thank you. Thank you very much. O K. Thank you, XXX02. O K. Have you bought anything in Japan? Have I bought anything? Yeah. Clothes or anything. Er I bought a couple of things, not so much. Yeah. I bought some clothes. And what else? Just mostly I've bought food. Browsed around in department stores? Yeah. I have browsed around at the department stores. Uh how do you find oh Japanese department stores? Actually, a lot of the stuff in the department stores I liked. I think it's really classy. Erm and if I could afford it, there's there's a lot I would buy, I think. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. People say that the service is very good. How do you find it? Erm I think wow when I walk into the department stores, I sometimes I think it's kind of overbearing. Because I'm I'm one of those people that likes to you know, like, likes to look around by herself. And then if I need help, then I like I'd like someone to be around so I can solicit their help. But I erm I think, in the Japanese stores, sometimes it feels like people are always watching you and seeing you, you know, ""Are you content? Are you finding everything you need?"" Maybe a little bit overwhelming. But, yeah, they are they are nice. And if you talk to them, then they'll do anything they can to help you. Hm. Hm. If you were gonna if you had that money and you we Hm. for example, there was some classy clothes you wanted to buy, laughter erm when you buy clothes, what kind of things do you take into account? Er I like really I'm I wanna know if they fit really well. And then er if I like the way they look and if I think that it's something that I can wear a lot and it's affordable, then I can buy it. It's a. In that in that order. Probably, yes. A lot of well when I'm shopping in the U S, a lot of times it's er finding clothes that fit me and that I like. And so if I find something that fits and that I like, and then if it's affordable, then I'll buy it. O K. Hm. Yes. . O K. Great. Erm two more things we have to get through. I want you to look at a sequence of pictures here. O K. Erm it goes from one to six. There're six pictures in a row. Hm. I I'd like you to make up a story Mh-hmm based around these pictures. O K. O K? Now, this happened before. So I'd like you to start your story with ""One day last week"". O K. And then go. The interviewee is looking at the pictures for a moment. O K. All right? Go. <.> Oh well one day last week, when I was walking to my er when I was walking to the station I was following this guy. And he was just a regular businessman, he had his bag. And we're I was standing in line waiting for the train to come. And he his er someone pushed him, I think, and his or something, and his bag fell onto the railway. And he's sitting there, and he's talking to the person that pushed him. He was like, ""Oh look look, what you did. My bag fell."". And er I don't like, just then the train came, and it went over. And he was he was really distressed, we were like, ""Oh my gosh. What's gonna happen? Is the train gonna be O K?"". And the train passed by and his bag was still there. Then so he's like he's all sweaty and stuff. And then the guy that the guy that hit him, that made his bag fall onto the train, he got down on I guess he probably called someone or somebody called someone. And er one of the people at the train station came and he got down there, and he gave him back his bag. Er it was just it was just a really funny thing to watch. laughter O K. Thank you very much, XXX02. Now, what's your what's the most curious thing you've seen on the infamous Japanese trains so far? The most curious thing? Oh probably, sometimes when we're oh well sometimes when we're coming back from the city, there's always some strangely dressed dressed people. Erm there's a I guess there's er I guess they're either teenagers or young adults. And they have like sniff the white makeup and the black hair and big boots and buckles, kind of a Gothic appeal, possibly. laughter It's kind of interesting. I mean you just want to look at or whatever. You know, no big deal, I guess. But it's interesting because by far, the vast majority of people are are not dressed like that in Japan. So laughter that makes it all the more stunning, I guess. laughter Just the contrast. sniff Right. Right. Erm when sniff ho you've been on some very crowded trains when you first got here, Hm. how did you react to that? Oh well. How did you deal with that? Wow. The first time I had to do that was at the airport terminal. And it was really I just thought it was er it was so crowded. I I think it's pretty hellish. I don't really like it at at all. But erm kind of you just kind of deal with it and you do what anybody else does. I just stare out the window and pretend nobody else is there. laughter That's the way to deal, I think. Er er forgive me if I'm wrong. But XXX09 sniff that's a Mh-hmm. ur that's pretty crowded, too, right? Yeah. XXX09 is pretty crowded. But the trains are maybe during rush hour, the trains get packed, but not to the same extent as they do here. I've never been in a situation like that in XXX09 laughter ever. You can usually even find a place to sit. So. Well that's not packed. Yeah. So it's it's not it's not ever that that bad bad. Right. Right. O K. Final thing. I want you to have a look at this er sequence of pictures again, Mh-hmm. XXX02. Erm again, make up a story from one to six. Mh-hmm. S this happened before. Please start, ""One day last week"", and make up a story. The interviewee is looking at the pictures for a moment. O K? sniff O K. Ah sigh one day last week, I was I was driving in my car, and all of a sudden this motorcycle was just comes up. And he's talking on the cell phone to, I don't know who, maybe like his girlfriend or somebody. And he's not even paying attention at all on the road. And he just comes comes around the corner and I I hit him, because obviously, there was nothing I could do, because I didn't even see him coming. sniff And this guy starts arguing with me about oh I hit him, look at his bike. And eventually the police come. And we're sitting there arguing. And I I showed the policeman that this guy was talking on his phone, which is, first of all, he shouldn't have even been doing that. So he wasn't paying attention to where he was going. And I'm sorry if I hit him, but it was really, more than anything, his fault. And so I talked to the policeman and whatever. And then finally, they just they just called the tow truck to get his scooter, and I went home. There fortunately, there wasn't really any major damage to my car. But still, it could have been really dangerous for him. O K. Thank you very much. O K. Now, have you ever been in an accident at all, XXX02? Mmm. When I was younger. Yeah. When I was a lot lot younger. Not not recently, I don't think. What was that, if I may ask? Er we were we were driving on this really small two-lane road. And my brother and sister were really young. sniff And I I was really young, too. No. Actually, my brother wasn't even born. So I was like seven. And erm my mom my mom had a head-on collision with someone coming up the opposite direction. Wow. Yeah. And I flipped over from the backseat into the front. And er my sister was hurt. And they took us in an ambulance. But every we were O K. And like our car was pretty messed up. But everyone was O K, surprisingly. It was a pretty bad accident. Yeah. It sounds pretty bad. Yeah, it was. Mmm. Do you drive yourself? I drive. Yes. . Not not here, but In the States. Yeah, in the States. Even though your apartment is really near the campus. I don't I don't have a car on campus, actually. I just walk. I take public transportation O K. out. But to get around around the place, What? you have a car. No. Not at all, actually. I I only drive when I'm visiting my parents in XXX11, or when I was working in XXX06, I would be driving. Oh you worked in XXX06? Mh-hmm. Yeah. Hm. If I may ask, what did you do there? Uh last I was I'm I did this internship program Hm. for my school. It's called a co-op program. And this means that I have a agreement with the employer that I'll go to school, and then I'll work with the employer, and then I'll go to school again, and work with the employer. So any time I was with working with the company in XXX06, then I was I would be driving I would drive to work and just use my car on a regular basis. But when I'm at school, I never drive. Hm. Er that program is finished now, of course. Er yeah. Well I I could continue it if I wanted to. Well I could continue to go back to the company if I wanted to. But I actually petitioned for a credit, so I don't have to do it anymore. So this su this following summer, I could work there. But I have the I have the liberty to work with another company, too, if I want to. sniff O K. O K. Great. Well we're almost coming to towards the end of the interview now. Mh-hmm. Erm what are your plans for the rest of the day? The rest of the day. Erm afterwards I have to I'm supposed to study ur we'll see if that actually happens. And then I have class from laughter it never it never actually works out that way. And then I have class from three-thirty to five-forty no, later, six-forty-five. And that's torture. And then I'll probably just go home and eat dinner and try to study for my exam tomorrow, if I can. Er. It's torture? Why is it torture? Because it well I don't really learn anything in class. Erm I have two classes. And one of them is one of them, the professor, he's a really interesting guy. But like the students take absolutely no interest in the class. And so there's never any possibility for discussion. He just talks on and on. Erm. Pretty weird. And wha what he has to say is interesting. But it's just like the the room like the atmosphere in the room is just so insipid that it just sucks the energy out of you. But sniff he's a cool guy. Like, I like talking to him after class and stuff. And then I have another class, which is it is Japanese joined American students. And I just it's just not really intellectually stimulating, I think. So I go to that. Then I'll I'll go home and eat dinner and study homework. How much longer in this program? Erm five and a half more weeks. laughter So So you'll be Yeah. back for Christmas time. Right before Christmas, I go back. Yeah. Yeah. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Any big challenges left while you're here? Big challenges. Erm school work is getting more. I guess just in volume, it's increasing, because I have to write some papers and do some projects which, up until now, I've just been, ""Oh that's in the distant future."". So that's coming up. Erm otherwise, not really. Things are just kind of like bogus. And so hopefully I'll get to travel a little bit more before I have to go back. Yeah. You might as well. Oh. I'd like to do that. You might as well. Yeah. But you're looking forward to getting back? I think so. Yeah. Enough. Enough, isn't it? No, I mean it's not that it's not so much of that. But I'm like all my friends are starting to graduate. And I'm getting getting kind of anxious. Like I wanna go go back to school. Since March, I haven't been in school because I've been working or I've been here. Hm hm. Hm. Hm. And so I think I really feel like it's time for me to go back and start Sure. using by brain again. So it should be good. I'm excited. I'm excited to go back to school. Sure. O K. Well thank you very much for your time this afternoon, Thank you. XXX02. O K. And that's the end of the interview, then. O K. Thank you very much. Thank you.",0
"N_file00015.txt 2002-11-14 male 20 USA 1_12m English electric shop ski invitation_intermediate landlord_intermediate travel_intermediate stray cat restaurant O K. So hello. My name is XXX01. May I have your name, please? Oh um my name is XXX02. Good to meet you, XXX01. Nice to meet you, XXX02? Mh-hmm. Yeah. O K. Erm hm so where are you from? I'm from well I'm from western XXX03. Mh-hmm. That's that's where my hometown is. Mh-hmm. And I spend most of my time in uh in XXX04 where my college is Hmm. is . Mh-hmm. Mh-hmm. O K. So. So um what's your um university like? My university. It's um it's a little university. Mh-hmm. It's the XXX05. There's only fourteen hundred students. And it's in an even smaller town, maybe a thousand people. And the town's on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere in XXX04. Hm. So, I mean, the school owns almost ten thousand acres. Hm. But most of that is forest and erm mountain walkways. And and there's actually a perimeter trail that's almost twenty-two miles all the way around the domain. laughter So it's it's really a beautiful campus. Hm. Uh-huh. So what do you study there? Well I'm I'm technically a psychology major right now. Mh-hmm. But when I registered for classes, um yesterday or, no, the day before yesterday, I decided that I was going to switch my major to English. Hmm. Mm but it's it's really a liberal arts school, so Mh-hmm. You know, I think next semester I'm gonna be taking um Chaucer, a creative writing seminar, a drawing course, and um I don't remember what what course I have school was. laughter Uh-huh. O K. And the B A course. Hm. So why are you changing majors? Psychology is um psychology, I find, is quite an interesting topic. But psychology is, to me, kind of like philosophy and high school teaching. It's one of those very important professions, Hm. very legitimate professions that's been almost ruined by most of the people who practice it. And I'm not quite dedicated enough to Ah. have to actually fight through and. Mh-hmm. So that's that's why . Uh-huh. And that as for English, I just always I do some writing as a hobby. I write as a hobby and I've been thinking about I sort of got a dream of about trying to get something published, and maybe make a little money out of that. Uh-huh. Probably. Hm. I haven't really made any plans yet. laughter O K. So now you're in Japan, Mh-hmm. um what do you do every day? Every day? Erm well every day, I usually get up, have um sometimes have breakfast with my host family, though I usually get up a little after they do. So I often don't see them in the morning. Start by heading to class. Um go through my classes, usually <.> just hang around a bit. Erm that's a weekday. I don't do anything too exciting most weekdays. Weekends, I often go into the city, go into maybe Shinjuku and Harajuku with friends and hang out there with everyone around. Though I started taking, actually three times a week, aikido lessons. Hm. So I've been doing that a lot of it lately. Hm. Could you tell me more about your host family? Well the host family is um well they're a Japanese family. It's a a younger couple, probably they're probably thirty-five, about. And their two small children, two daughters aged six and three. Hmm. Which um they're not very traditional Japanese. We live in we live in a mansion mm in one of the mansions or the apartments. And er the only real Japanese feature of the building to be seen is the one shoji screen out on the balcony. Hm. But er it's er let's see, the kids are the six-year-old goes to she is, I guess, a first-year elementary school student. The three-year-old stays home with mom all day. And erm the father goes out and works. I asked him what it is he did, but I didn't really understand the answer. laughter And so Uh-huh. so I'm a little sketchy, on what exactly his job is. But erm he goes out, usually gets home moderately late, eight, nine. He got home at ten yesterday. I think that's only moderately late for a Japanese businessman, though. So er and let's see. It's I'm not quite as self-sufficient as I usually am. I put my clo dirty clothes in the magic hamper in the morning, laughter and in the evening, they show up in my room folded, Wow. which I feel kind of bad about sometimes. But Hm. sometimes I do the dishes when I sneak into the kitchen if er laughter the mother is chasing after the three-year-old or something. Uh-huh. Ah. That's really it. Mm-hm. Sounds like a nice family. They they really are. Hm. They really are. They the kids get very annoying sometimes the kids get very annoying sometimes. But six- and three-year-old. Hm. So I guess they're almost supposed to. laughter So. Sure. Sure. O K. Well um we're gonna move on. And I'll show you a picture. If you'll describe what you see here. Sure. Um well it looks like an electronics counter in some sort of department store, probably. Er we've got a younger younger male or or maybe female looking, looks like he's asking questions about a question about some product on display to a sales clerk standing nearby. He might be pointing at the watches, I'm not sure. But looks like he's talking about just how wonderful the product they're selling is. Er maybe one of the T Vs, I don't exactly know. So he's got a customer interested. And so some of the stereos are almost frightening. You know, the s the s the stereo is almost frighteningly large. I don't think I've ever seen a stereo that big in my life. laughter But er is there anything specific you'd like me to talk about? Oh no. It's O K, yeah. That's. . Yeah. Thanks. O K. You're welcome. Erm all right. So I'm sure you've done some shopping around Tokyo or this area. Mh-hmm. Mh-hmm. Um. Could you tell me about an interesting shop you've walked into? Well let's see. There're all sorts of interesting shops. Um what was it? There's a there's a store in Harajuku actu it may I think it's a chains with a lot of locations, I think it has two in Harajuku called either Chicago or Chicago's. Mh-hmm. Uh it's a used clothing store. They sell just all sorts of strange things um. Hm but fairly cheap as far as clothing in Japan goes. And I went in there and bought this odd coat. It's kind of like well it's a black wool long coat, and it goes down almost to my ankles. It's if you take a trenchcoat and take the sleeves off a trenchcoat and then put a mantle over it, Uh-huh. it's kind of like that. laughter I I don't know exactly what it would be called. But I adore long coats. Yeah. Ah. I picked that up. Um what else is there? There's a tap there's a neat little used bookstore that I stop in occasionally. It's pretty near where I live. It's er just a couple minutes in the other direction from the nearest station to the apartment I'm staying in. And I stop in there occasionally and er pick up some used manga or something like it. And <.>. Probably go some place else. I don't know. laughter Well going back to that coat, Oh yeah. erm when you go shopping for clothes, Mh-hmm. how do you usually decide what do buy? Well I usually just I don't normally go shopping for clothes exactly. Ah-huh. But it's more that I'm walking along, Uh-huh. look at a store, looks like they might have something interesting, I just stop in, pick some things that look attractive, look at them, check the price Mh-hmm. to see what their price is. Lots of prices here in Japan seem extremely erratic. And, like, as far as I can tell, almost the same shirt from two different stores could be sen en or it could be ni man en. Uh-huh. But I check the price, try it on, and erm if I like it, I've been indulging myself. Usu I worked two summers before I came to Japan for this trip. And I was so good with my paychecks. And um I stopped being good with my paychecks. Mh-hmm. Well O K. So you're enjoying that coat? Um. laughter I haven't worn it too often. But I re I really like it, though. Mh-hmm. O K. Oh too bad I can't see it. laughter All right. Next picture. Um if you could describe this. Oops. Right. Sure. It's erm it looks like it's at one of those ski resort places or mountain, I'm thinking a mountain ski resort and you've got people skiing. And um one of those little log cabin buildings nearby that you see in that type of place. There's erm a number of people skiing downhill. Plus one of those lifts that they use to go back up. There's n er there's no one actually on the lift. That's kind of strange. For that matter, this one woman is skiing sideways. I've never been skiing, so maybe that's completely normal, going sideways. Nearby, there are some kids er with snowballs throwing snowballs at each other. And um and they look like they're having a grand old time. I noti I miss snow. Tokyo is a bit warm for my for my liking. I like the cold weather. And er inside the log cabin, up at the top left of the picture, it looks like well if I had to guess, it looks like there's a guy and a girl in there flirting with each other over cups of coffee. I could be reading too much into the picture. O K. All right. Thanks. There you go. Uh-huh. So um what were you doing this time of the year last year? This time of the year last year. What was I doing? laughter Hm. Probably er I guess the ur I guess this time of the year last year, I was um I was doing a lot of drawing, it's a it's a hobby of mine. Mh-hmm. And um I actually met this person on line who runs an amateur fiction site. She writes and posts the stories on line. I really like some of her stuff. So I started doing a lot of art for her. And we're actually really good friends now. I just got a long e-mail from her. But ur I was doing a lot of drawing. Er probably not studying nearly as much as I should have. And um usually, yeah, especially first semester last year, I went to uh martial arts three or four times a week. So that's probably most of what I was doing. One of my friends, we were second semester, I spent a lot of time with her. First semester, she was actually abroad with friends. So she wasn't around this time of year last year. Mh-hmm. And beyond that, I guess it just varied from day to day. Urm nothing too spectacular. laughter All right. Um next, we're going to do a couple of role-plays. And I'll give you a card. So if you could read it and let me know when you're ready. Sure. cough The interviewee is reading the card. O K. I'm ready. O K? All right. It's a phone conversation. So I'll start. Ring-ring. Hello? This is XXX01. Oh hi, XXX01. How are you? Good. How are you? Well pretty good, pretty good. Um. Uh-huh. Just kind of hanging out. Uh-huh. Um . Oh hey, actually, I was thinking abo I was thinking about going to the movies. Uh-huh. Ha have you seen the new Harry Potter movie? Actually, no. Oh. Er I mean, the first one was really adorable, so Uh-huh. and well the book was a lot of fun. So you are you free tonight or? Um well I'm working. O K. O K. Um well let's I mean, do you want to see the movie or? Actually, I haven't seen ""One"" either. Oh O K. Well that's er not not . Well I think you should see the first one sometime. It's really a fine movie. O K. Hm. But erm hm hm. O K. Er that's too bad. I was but maybe, you know, sometimes we should get together. I mean we'll go to movie and go for coffee or something. Mh-hmm. But I'd love to watch something. Oh O K. Erm well if you're working tonight, er tomorrow? Sure. O K. Is er what would you like to see? Hmm. Anything funny. O K. I'll I guess I'll take a look at what's showing and see if like about what time would be good for you? Erm well I'd like to sleep in. So how about one? O K. About one. Yeah, I'll see what's showing around then. Erm you want me to pick you up or vice versa, or what would be good for you? Erm. I think it's a little far to walk. laughter Sure. We could meet up at Shinjuku. O K. Is that O K? Yeah. Shinjuku Shinjuku is fine with me. O K. Um O K. Yeah. I'll er I'll give you a call or maybe e-mail you back about yeah, I'll just e-mail you with a a funny-sounding movie and what time it's showing. And if that's cool, just er e-mail me back. O K. Sounds good. O K. I'll All right. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Thanks for calling. Good. Bye. Bye. laughter Hm. All right. That's the end of the role-play. Thanks. O K. Um right. So er you said there wasn't much around near your university. No, not much. So how do you and your friends enjoy your free time? Well it's erm a lot of ti the fraternities are pretty popular on campus because it's there's quite a mix of fraternities. I sort of I'm not actually a fraternity member, but I hang out with the er D K fraternity, which they're kind of the like ordinary fraternity. Mh-hmm. But um er frat parties are pretty big. Beyond that, just usually just hanging out in people's rooms, watching movies. Um Uh-huh. speaking of role-playing, I never quite got over that like thirteen-year-old obsess well not obsession, but like playing Dungeons and Dragons and some more games. Oh. Uh-huh. So I sometimes do some gaming with friends, wat watch movies, just hang ou there are I mean, there's a coffee shop, a few restaurants in town. And like a one-screen theater which airs a new film every week or two. And then it's a half an hour to the nearest Wal-Mart. So that's usually like a trip of three or four people. Ah. laughter We get together and go to Wal-Mart for a couple hours. Wow. And you make sure you got everything you need. laughter And er get on back. So and then sometimes just sometimes maybe actually making dinner in the dorm's kitchen, so maybe make dinner or most of my I think I mentioned a few times, I do martial arts, and most of my friends do, too. So I guess it's a sport, basically. Pretty much like any other one. And beyond that, that's that's I think that's I think the bulk of what I what I do Hmm. on the normal days Mh-hmm. Did you say you were the living in a dorm? Yeah. It's um O K. it's such a small town. So mm ninety-eight percent of the students live in dorms. Uh-huh. There are couple apartments for rent in XXX06, but just a very few students live in the dorms. O K. So back in XXX03, you were living with your parents? Yeah. When I'm back there for I usually only go back for the two longer breaks. Spring break and Christmas break, they actually close the dorms. And um this past summer, I actually stayed at XXX06 working in the computer lab. So I only went home briefly fo for maybe three weeks, and then I came to Japan. I think probably this next summer I'll stay at school and work again. Hm. I see. O K. So um the next role-play. Um I don't know if you've done this before, but um if you read that and let me know. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. All right? O K. May I help you? Uh yeah. I'm looking to rent an apartment in the area. Mh-hmm. I'd um I'd like it to be I go to school in Makuhari. So I'd like it to be somewhere fairly close. And um um I'm going to school, so I'm on a fairly limited budget, Mh-hmm. too. So er do you have have well I don't know - what are normal what do students normally rent if they're looking for an apartment in this area? You know better than I do. Well it depends whether you want to live alone or share. Mh-hmm. I have um I might do you think we could maybe get a few examples of both? I haven't found a roommate yet, but there are a couple you know, there are a couple people who I might who I might want to share a room with if they're interested. Mh-hmm. O K. Um we have about three rooms that would be good for sharing. O K. How much what's the monthly rental on those? Um each of you would pay thirty thousand yen. O K. Thirty thousand yen. Is that um are utilities on top of that, or? Yes. O K. Um what's what's the nearest station ? Um actually, Maihama. O K. Maihama, that's um which line is that on? It's on the same line to come to Makuhari, er Keiyo. O K. O K. So it's on yeah, it's on the Keiyo Line. How many stops to Kaihin Makuhari? A couple. laughter Oh O K. Sorry. Um O K. O K. Well that wouldn't be bad. Um. S are these just er one-room apartments or? Um well no. Two bedrooms and a small living room. O K. O K. Yeah, my friend's got a roommate in this tiny little one-room, but that's in the middle of Shinjuku. So that's a little different. Hmm. O K. Mh-hmm. So would you like to set up an appointment to look at it? Yeah. I'd like to take a look at it. O K. Um I let's see, I I'm I'm usually in class until about three o'clock. But would sometime after that work for you? Fine. Any time before six. Any time before six. Yeah. Then er four-thirty? O K. O K. Er there's no problem if I bring if I find someone who might want to room with me? Sure, right. Not a problem. All right. I may bring someone else along, then. O K. So I will wait for you to call to confirm this, and then we'll be ready to go. All right. O K. Thank you. I'll make sure to call to confirm in a bit, then. O K. Thank thank you much. O K. End of that role-play. O K. So em back to that topic about living in a dorm. Urm could you compare the difference of lifestyle, living in a dorm and back home? Oh living in a dorm and back home. It's um it's kind of peculiar. In a way, I like living in a dorm because I actually have my own space Hm. more than I do back home. Because mm my mom collects a lot of things. So my room sometimes serves as a storehouse. Hm. But my dorm room, I just got er like bed, desk and everything else there is mine to do with as I see fit. Er I don't really mi I mean, it's a little cramped, but I don't really mind that. It's actually it's actually really nice having other people around sometimes. The noise doesn't bother me. So actually, I really like living in a dorm. And I ge I get along much better with my parents when I'm not living under the same roof. Hm. We get along much better. Mh-hmm. So actually, in a way, I really prefer living in a dorm, especially especially, my freshman year roommate and I got along well. My sophomore year, actually, I was single. Then this summer, I was in a different dorm room where I had a roommate. And that that was er that was special special. He was j he was um he didn't bathe very often. laughter And er I remember from my freshman year when I actually met him the first time. I didn't request him as a roommate this summer. We were just assigned. But I met him in my freshman year and I remember him being a fairly bright, witty person. But in the intervening year or so, he seems to have smoked himself retarded. Oh. Mh-hmm. Mh-hmm. So how did you deal with that situation? I don't know that I really did anything to deal with that situation. I just I didn't spend too much time in the room. Hm. Really. Wow. laughter It was er so I don't know that I'm necessarily a big fan of the well well I've found some really good roommates there, so I wasn't necessarily a big fan of that roommate. laughter I see. It's not always bad. Hm. My senior year of high school, I actually roomed with a er Japanese student. Mm he w he was really cool. Hm. We still keep in touch Great. couple years later. Hm. Um. laughter O K. We have one last role-play. Um. Sure. This one, O K? The interviewee is reading the card. O K? O K. All right. May I help you? Ah yeah. I've been I've been thinking about a trip abroad Mh-hmm. and I've got some ideas about where I want to go er what type of place I want to go to and Mh-hmm. But I'm not quite sure where, exactly. So I wonder if you might be able to help me out. Oh of course. We've got lots of packages and cheap um airfare. O K. Well I was thinking I was thinking I'd like to visit someplace kind of urban, because I come from a small town. So it'd be a nice change. But maybe not maybe not without completely without natural settings. But probably some place fairly urban. Um. If there's a decent number of English speakers, that would be nice. I I mean, I only speak English and, a little bit of Japanese. But um probably someplace like that. I'll be traveling I'll be traveling alone. Mh-hmm. I'm traveling alone. And um you know, beyond that, I guess er that's do you have any, perhaps, brochures about the well I haven't been too specific yet. Maybe anything springs to mind with just what I've said? Oh sure. Um well we've got a bunch for domestic and, you know, foreign destinations. I was thinking I was thinking that I might actually want to go abroad. I O K. I haven't been abroad much. So O K. might make for a fun vacation. All right. Well er English-speaking. How about Singapore? Singapore? Yeah. It's quite urban. That's very true. I see. Well er well what do people usually go to Singapore for? Um. Uhh. Well <.> they've got a bunch of er botanical gardens and like safari parks. O K. Yeah. Yeah. That soun that sounds neat. that sounds like a lot of fun. I've been interested in East Asia for a while. Mh-hmm. So that might not be a bad idea. Do you have some Singapore brochures? Of course. O K. Do you think I could take a few of those to maybe look at? Sure. O K. Hm let's see. Hm Singapore. Around how much is a round-trip airfare to Singapore? Just airfare? Mm. Would be er six hundred dollars. O K. And er if I stay for two weeks, around what would I expect to spend on just room and board? Uh at a budget hotel maybe two weeks, ur a thousand dollars. O K. Two weeks a thousand dollars. O K. Yeah, that that's that's not too bad, actually, particularly for an open vacation. O K. O K. Yeah. It sounds like this might be a good thought. We can start to put a package together for you. Um probably not right here. Uh. I'd like to take take these and look at them a little longer. Sure, sure. Give a little more thought about it. But. Um. All right. So if you're interested, you can call me back and Yeah, er yeah. I think I'll take it from there. I think I'll probably I think I probably will do this, but er I'll call you back when I've made a decision, probably in a day or two. Very good. O K. O K. Yeah. Thank you, ma'am. Thanks. Bye-bye. End of that one. All right. So any plans to travel? I mean, you're in Japan now, but elsewhere? Er travel elsewhere? Um elsewhere in Japan or just elsewhere? Anywhere. laughter Yeah. I mean, I won't have much time to travel in Japan because it's been a very busy semester Hm. and it's gonna stay that way. Er I don' know. I'll be go I mean, I'll be going home and finishing college. I'll probably be <.> the only likely the only place I'd be going is maybe to a convention with a friend in San Francisco next year. I've been thinking about maybe coming back to Japan Hm. after I graduate. And er there are a lot of place there are a lot of places that I'd sort of like to see, but nothing I've got really plans to go to. Like I'd like to visit Italy and Greece. I'd like to visit England. But I was if and when that'll actually happen, I don't have any real plans yet. Mh-hmm. There's a lot of things I'd like to see. I'd like to see some I've got I'm pretty interested in classical Greece. I'd like to see some of the er ruins left there so I get sense of that. Um no plans as of yet. Mm-hm. O K. Then er could you tell me about the best trip you've ever had? Best trip I've ever had. <.> I think I'm gonna have to call it this trip to Japan, actually. This is really the first time I've ever been abroad. But Hm. well really to a foreign country unless you count Canada, which most people wouldn't. Hm. So it's been it's just been a really interesting experience, especially when you have a language barrier. I I can get around, but I'm far short from fluent. Mh-hmm. So my days are usually spent on stretching my language capacity to probably as far as it goes before it snaps completely. And sometimes it does snap completely, like when I say things like korewa just chotto sticky. laughter I was talking about mochi. Uh-huh. Hm. But it's been and I've just seen I've met some really neat people here and seen some really interesting things. And just living in, you know, Greater Tokyo has been I mean I go to school in a town of a thousand people, a school of fourteen hundred. So Hm. this has been a really neat change. So it's been it's been kind of difficult sometimes, but by and large I've had a great time here in Japan. I'm glad to hear that. All right. Now, lastly, Hm. I'd like to and you're going to make up a story um using these pictures here. And they go this way. Yeah. O K. One to six. And sigh this happened before. So if you could start your story with ""One day last week"". . O K. Well one day last week, er Bill and Jane were walking back home from school in the rain. It was well it was raining. But the temperature was fairly pleasant and they were having a nice little conversation. They'd been friends for a long time. And ur Bill thought he heard something, a sort of mm plaintive mewing sound, and wasn't quite sure what it was. But then Jane realized it was coming from this just random cardboard box lying on the side of the road. She looked in there, and she found this poor, soaking wet, draggled kitten. No collar or tags or anything. And just trying to figure out what to do with it. And asked Bill and he goes like, ""No, no, no, no. I can't take that thing home. My mom's working and my dad's allergic to cats, only smell of them and he hates cats. That'd be a mess. Well er I mean it's a little lost kitten like soaking in the rain."". Jane just oh Jane just loves this thing. So trying to figure out what to do with it. I mean Bill, he he's always claiming not to like cats. But, you know, he is just in touch with laughter It's a poor little lost kitten. So what they finally decide to do was that somehow they're going to find a way to keep it. But in first, they're going to er um put up a few posts to make sure that no one has actually lost this thing, and it doesn't actually have tags or anything like that. So they walk off, carrying the kitten home. O K. cough So what do you usually do on rainy days? laughter Carry an umbrella. Um I don't I'm not a big fan of rainy days. So I try to stay in if that's a possibility. Er usually, I still have to go so I just carry an umbrella, and there I go. Nothing there's nothing really special I do. Yeah. O K. You said you're from XXX03, and it must be quite cold there in the winter. It it gets chilly there. I actu I like the cold. Oh. So my ho my host parents think I'm very strange sometimes. They <.> they keep asking me if I need more blankets. laughter So I'm like, ""No, no, no. I I'm fine. I'm fine."". Er I don't think I don't think they believe me. laughter I really don't think they believe me. But, yeah, I actually like chilly weather. So in a way, it'll be sort of nice to go back to XXX03 in December. Mh-hmm. What are you planning to do there as soon as you get home? Well as soon as I get home, I might sleep for about thirty-six hours. The laughter jet lag's going to be bad. But um I'll go and do I mean I guess I'll be picked up by my family at the airport, and then going to er <.> reacquaint myself with some food that's been well not impossible to get in Japan, but impossible to get in Japan without spending way more money on it. Uh-huh. I don't really have any business doing. Probably go to a steak house with my dad. It's always fun to be with him. See some of my friends back home. Those are really my first plans. Mh-hmm. O K. Now, speaking of <.> some food, laughter so the next picture sequence. If you can make up another story. The interviewee is looking at the pictures. O K. Well let's see. Erm. Oh and start with ""One day last week"". Oh yes. And start with ""One day last week"". Erm well one day last week, er <.> Carl, a senior psychology major, had er just finished taking his comprehensive exams. Erm as was tradition, Professor er Benson, the head of the psychology department, offered to take him out to dinner at some place any place he opted to go. So they er go out looking around town. And Carl sees a restaurant that he's been meaning to try possibly, and points over and says, ""Hey, what do you think of that place?"" And Professor Benson's like, ""Whatever you like. It's your decision."". So they er go in. Er they are seated at a table by a waiter there, take a look at the menu. Looks like a looks like a pretty nice setup. A little expensive. It's actually paid for in the faculty budget. So er Professor Benson does not mind in the least. They er well maybe the meal goes quite pleasantly. They talk about many things besides psychology, comprehensive exam. It's sort of a rule that they would actually do that. Yeah. Sit down, have a nice meal, chicken, fish, have a few beers together, and er talk about what er Carl's planning on doing after graduation. They er Professor Benson has the bill sent back to the accounting department, which is the practice. And they part full and happy. Uh-huh. O K. Thank you. Yeah. So um does something like that really happen? Do students go out to dinner with faculty members? Yeah, sort of. My school does have comprehensive exams at the end. And a lot of the faculty members a lot of the depa I know philosophy de I know the philosophy department does it. They do actually get most of the faculty members and the senior majors who've just taken the comprehensive exams, and they go to a restaurant in town. And and, yeah, the students get dinner and a couple beers compliments of the department. laughter So. Have you had that experience yourself? Well I'm only a junior. Oh. But maybe when I graduate. I don't know if the English department does. I guess I'll find out next year, though. Hm. That all being an upper classman is kind of strange. Hm. I see. Um yeah, I mean that's sort of like it happens. Sort of that's ur. O K. So um we're wrapping up with this interview. And um what are you going to do after this? Well I was er ah yeah, I was going to go by go by a store, I promised a friend of mine back home I'd like to look for this odd necklace I've seen which she liked the looks of. Hm. Mh-hmm. Cheap little piece of chintzy jewelry. It's kind of like a sword blade maybe an inch long with a pair of wings coming off the side. laughter Hm. She loved it. So I was going to and look for such a thing for her. tap And after that, probably head on back to the apartment. I see. No real plans. Uh-huh. But do you have like a tight schedule until you go home? Er mm not mm not terribly. Not today anyway. Hm. O K. Mh-hmm. Hm. What other cities are you going to visit returning? To erm today I'll be going two stops down to er XXX07, I think. What's the name of the place? I just remember it's two stops down. Uh-huh. XXX07, I think. Mh-hmm. But I'm going there and probably going back from there to er XXX08 wherever. Ah. So I think that's all that's on the schedule for today. Tomorrow, I have to go into Tokyo, into XXX09 where I teach English twice a week. Oh wow. So that's what I do tomorrow. Mh-hmm. Are you enjoying that? It it's a lot of fun. It's erm it takes almost two hours to get to that house, really. laughter But Hm. it is a lot of fun. O K. Hm. O K. So um thank you very much for coming by today. Well thank you for. laughter And I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay. I most certainly try. O K.",0

My name is XXX01. May I have your name, please? My name is XXX02. Nice to meet you, XXX02. Nice to meet you. Mm XXX02. Yeah. O K. Um where are you living now? In Japan, I'm living in ur XXX03. Mm-hm. It's about twenty minutes actually from XXX04, Mh-hmm. walking. laughter O K. So. Do you like it there? Yeah. It's ur I live with a seventy-four-year-old urm woman. Really? Yeah. So it's a host family stay. And, ur yeah, it's I have a lot of freedom, and it's pretty nice. Mm. Hm. O K. Something more about the host family? O K. Well urm it's basically me and ur her. She's a widow. She urm it's me, her, and she has a little tiny dog that lives outside. Ur she hasn't named the dog, the Dog's the name. laughter laughter cough She's she has she has had a lot a lot of the same type of dog. It's a Pomeranian. Uh-huh Urm so she calls all of she's called all of her dogs wan-wan which is laughter which is which is bowwow basically naming your dog, ""Bowwow"". And ur we talk usually in breakfast and at dinnertime urm ur because she's usually sleeping because she's seventy actually she's seventy-six she's seventy-six, not seventy-four. Urm s ur and her birthday was like about it was last month. And so she's seventy-six years old. And so she's always sleeping. And so we don't really talk that much, maybe at like ur dinner and stuff. Ur and I ha she has every like every other week on Wednesdays, she has a ur English conversation party that I help her out with. And ur basically, I just tell her if I can't come home or if I'm gonna be home late, and then whenever she doesn't so she doesn't have to prepare mm dinner. And everything is she's lots of freedom. And ur I have a T V in my room. Ur and mm O K. All right. maybe that's about it. Yeah. So what goes on in this English conversation party? Ur at the English conversation party, basically it's just me and u about maybe five or six, ur they're Japanese native speakers Japanese people who're like basically all we do is we just speak in English. I mean, there is nothing really uh we just eat and speak in English. And sometimes sometimes it ends up being just like me speaking in Japanese, too because like they don't understand the English. But like they just uu try to get together and speak as much English as possible. It's usu it's actu they're like the ages range, really from like twenty-five to like seventy six. laughter So but she's like the oldest one. Right. They're like they're like forties, fifties, Uh-huh. most of them. Mm. Yeah. And how's your Japanese? My Japanese? Ur it's O K. It's a lot better than when I first came here. Like if I didn't really think it was getting that much better, but like I realize that my I'm processing it a lot faster so that I might be able to speak a lot easier in Japanese. But um it's it's still like it's still not fluent or anything, but like I still can't like if I watch T V, I can't understand. But maybe like approximately, I can understand. Hm. Great. So other than taking classes, um what do you do to improve your language? cough Urm watch I watch televi Japanese television. I read ur I bought a lot of manga that I'm trying to read. Urm so I sit down with the manga, and like I put my electronic dictionary to my right, and just look up the words I don't know. Urm problem is like the the biggest like problem in learning Japanese is learning colloquial Hmm. ur because they don't teach it at the school, and and like it's used a lot in television and in mangas. So like there's like cer a certain colloq that like you have a certain amount of colloquial expressions like knowledge of certain expressions, but like you don't know like certain there's like a lot of sometimes they use a lot of bad words, I guess. So like they don't teach in the class. So like ur I don't but I don't know whether it's bad word or not. So like if I ask a Japanese native speaker like, ""What this word means?"". They're like, ""Ohh yeah, you can say you shouldn't say that, you shouldn't say that."". But I still wanna know just so I know it's a bad word. Right. So but la that's like mm the biggest obstacle. That and like there's like certain grammar, and there sometimes I don't know if it's grammar or if it's like if it's the word or if it's like a dictionary word I don't know. Mh-hmm. So manga, television, urm speaking to Japanese native speakers, and urr Japanese songs, karaoke is a good karaoke is a good ur way to karaoke karaoke is is a good way to ur like practice your reading because like it goes at a certain rate so like you try to keep up with it and stuff. And so you kind of have to like process it faster. So that's pretty helpful, too. Mhm. So you've made some friends who are Japanese, right? Japanese. Mm-hm. And what do you do with them? cough This weekend, we're actually going to Kyoto. And ur you know, usually we just hang out. Maybe drink or ur eat I eat lunch with them or ur the XXX05 has an e-pal program. Uh-huh. We ur like you back at like before you come to Japan, you have um you speak through e-mail, and then once you get here, like they they're like yo your e-pal kind of takes care of you and stuff. So like me and my e-pal are pretty close, and ur her best friend, mm so I usually hang out with them. Usually just have lunch or urm me and some of the XXX05 people and Japanese people go out maybe to like drink or laughter on Fridays, or or and we're going to Kyoto this weekend so we travel together, too, you know. I see. O K. All right. Now, I'm going to show you some pictures. And I want you to describe what you see. O K. <.> O K. Ur. Just ev. . O K. Urm all right. This guy looks like he fell off of the slope of the ski lift. This person over here is sliding down the <.> hill. Urm these guys look like they're being taught how to ski by this guy right here. Urm they're having a snow fight way to the left. And there's a couple that's inside the cabin who are talking to each other. Looks like a couple. Urm and she looks lost. Maybe she's looking for the class. laughter I don't know. And she sees the guy that's her on the that fell off the ski lift. Mmm the there are there is a snowman next to the snow prowl truck. There's a bunch of skies and a snowboard. Urm <.> urr there's mount there's a big mountain in the back the sky mm with sky and bunch of trees with snow on top of them. O K. O K. Thanks. Ur so do you ski at all? I don't ski at all. laughter laughter All right. I never e I I've never played in the snow. So. Yeah. Oh O K. Yeah. Why not? Oh. Because when I was a kid, like it used to snow sometimes in where I lived, but like my mom never let me go outside and play. Because. laughter ? So I now live in XXX06. Uh-huh. Oh O K. So now, it doesn't really laughter it doesn't snow at all. Right. Right. So I never yeah, never ne so I've never got to ski, but I wanna ski. Uh-huh. Mm-hm. Urm <.> so in XXX06, Mm-hm. urm it doesn't snow. What's? What is there to do? laughter Yeah. What do you do in the wintertime? In the wintertime, it's s usually still pretty relatively warm. It's it gets a little bit colder, but it just gets miserably cold, not like anything like you can do in the wintertime. So like it's just it's k it it rains so it's like sometimes humid and then it's still cold. Mh-hmm. It's just really bad weather. laughter XXX06 doesn't have that good weather. Right. Yeah. Nothing to do in the winter. Right. O K. Is there a sport that you like to do? Mm basketball. I like basketball. Yeah. Mm O K. Urm but I haven't been able to play in Japan or anything because of time restraints. But, yeah, if I get home, ur I play basketball whenever I can. But even then, it's still hard to be time for it. Yeah. How did you get started? Urm mm played with the neighborhood kids back when I was like maybe around started when I was like in er fifth grade. Mh-hmm. And just play like I used I bought a basketball goal in my house, and put it on the top of the garage. And just people started coming over when I was shooting around, just made friends, and we just started playing basketball. That's how I started. Mm. And I enjoy it. Yeah. cough Mhm O K, I see. So next picture is this one. O K. Urm looks like a salesman dressed in the blue turquoise blue and <.> turquoise jacket and er blue jeans who is selling trying to sell <..> everything. laughter Trying to sell watches maybe to a to a customer in a white jacket and blue jeans. Ur the customer looks like he's asking a question and he's pointing something. But then ur the sales person is like ur I don't know I don't know how that could be happening but and the sales person is ur saying to come this way. And looks like the customer is just asking him and pointing him about er some q question here as on the product. Urr. <.> Did you want me to describe everything or ? Oh no, it's O K. O K. laughter Great. Um so have you been to a place called Akihabara? Yeah. I. where there's lots of electrical stuff, the stores? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Can you tell me about that? Ur O K. Ur it was actually not like the best thing mm that I've done in Japan because like it's really dizz it makes you really dizzy. Because ur that then the picture, there's only two people, but like in Akihabara, it's just so many people. And there're just so many stores on the same things that you don't really know what to buy. And in addition, like you don't know whether you're getting the right price or whe whether you're paying too much or paying too little, maybe you could've paid less because there's just so many stores. So you feel like you have to go to all the stores before you can buy something. That's that's how I felt. So like it was a little bit stressful actually. I went there to buy my electronic dictionary, and I mean, I ended up getting a good d good deal for it. But urm it still is really just stressful. I just like only just said like, ""O K, I'm just gonna buy a dictionary,"" just because I was just tired from the amount of people and just the amount of stores. Just it's really dizz eh just your eyes just started like getting cross-eyed and stuff. Oh uh-huh. Right. Mm. So when you get stressed out, how do you usually deal with it? Usually like well as far as like in that situation went, and like it was kind of like I just wanted to come I just wanted to go back home. Mh-hmm. So I like eh there was a certain there's certain like I have a certain like limit, I guess, like there's a point of breaking, laughter or like it just kind of like, ""O K, that's it."". Like I just wanna I'll just get something so I can go go back home. Just because like I don't like the atmosphere, and just like it just like getting dizzy and stuff, and like it's physically, I almost felt like I was getting sick because there's just so many people and just so many stores and stuff. So like <.> at that point, like like in that that kind of situation, like I just wanted to come back home. Like the same thing happened er when I went to Disneyland, Disney Sea. There're just so many people and like waiting in line the whole time. You just get tired and so like urm I just wanted to go back home just like rest and stuff. So I don't know if that's how I deal with stress, but in this laughter in this situation, it's. Yeah, sure. O K. So you won't be going back? Yeah. laughter laughter I mean, if I have to buy something, I'll go to Akihabara. But it's not the best place to go, yeah. laughter All right. So now, we're going to do a couple of role-plays. And I'll give you a card, and I'd like you to read it. And let me know when you're ready. O K. The interviewee is reading the card. Mm. O K. Yes, may I help you, sir? Yeah. I was wondering if I can get urr the next ticket to New York from here. laughter Oh O K. Urm how much is it gonna be? Ur well it depends on ur the speed of the train. I want the fastest train. O K. How much how much would that be? Uh-huh. Express is fifty dollars one way. Mh-hmm. O K. Urm what about the other how much are the other Uh-huh. how much are the other ways I could get there? Right. Urm the next fastest train ur takes half an hour longer, and it's thirty dollars one way. Mm. I see. Is there any stopovers or anything on any of the in the second train? Urm yeah. The second fastest train makes one stop. Mm. What time is the what time is the first train? First train is leaving in half an hour. Mm. Is that for the is that for both types of uh both the express and the one that makes a stopover? Urm no. The second one will leave five minutes later. I see. cough Urm O K. Then I'll take the first train out of here. laughter O K. All right. So urm yeah, fifty dollars for one ticket. Yeah. One way. O K, one way. Here you go. Thank you very much. Hm. O K. That's the end of the role-play. Mm. <.> And so where exactly in XXX06 do you live? In XXX07. Oh O K. So it's a pretty big city. Yeah. Uh-huh. A pretty big city. And I study at the XXX08 at XXX09. So it's about two and a half hours from XXX07 if you're driving. Oh O K. Urm I don't know about the places. But could you compare XXX09 and XXX07? XXX07 is. Erm. In terms of living there? O K. XXX07 is more like it's a big city. So like everything is to get to point A from point A to point B, it's usually like at least to get ten-minute-drive to wherever you wanna go cough at least from where I live in. Well I live in the suburbs. And so like that's about maybe thirty to forty-five minutes from downtown. Mh-hmm. And that's like if there's no traffic. If there's traffic, it's usually about an hour, hour and a half. And urm like schoo the university that most of the students go to in XXX07 is in downto it's a commuting school, XXX10. So like everyone has to drive like from suburbs about like an hour, hour and a half everyday to school and back. And ur <.> in terms of living, like there's it's a lot cheaper in XXX07 than it is in XXX09. XXX09 is more XXX09 is more compact like, it's a university town because Universi XXX08 is like, I don't know, it's the first or second biggest university in the United States. So there's about fifty-five thousand students. So like there's it's it's like a university like town so like everything is just really close together. So like, if I wanted to go to like McDonald's or something, it takes me like a minute or something that like drive to anywhere, like maybe two minutes. But like in XXX07, I mean, well there's McDonald's or millions of , and but like like if I wanted to go to like the mall or something, it's not that far. It's like maybe two or three minutes. But like the mall in XXX07 would take me about ten, fifteen minutes to get there. So everything is just like really close together like, it's kind of like New York like everything is just uh ur because I live in downtown. Whereas in XXX07, I live in the suburb so everything is just spread out, like houses, residential areas, friends' houses. And like in terms of living, or like because I live in XXX07, like everyone's like living with their parents so like you can't like always ur just like go over to someone's house and just relax and just um talk. But like in XXX09, everyone's because like they don't have ur their families with them like everyone's kind of like ur more close because like they you can go to each other's house and just talk and just relax and just like socialize and stuff. So in terms of like social like freedom, there's a lot more in XXX09. Hmm. I see. And ur living in the also I noticed like living in the United States as opposed to Japan is a lot more spontaneous. Like so like like it's in Japan, like everyone like we've all like noticed like that it's really you have to like plan like what you wanna do like in months or in weeks in advance. Like this Kyoto trip, like they planned it like maybe uh at least a good month and a half ago. But like in well in Austin, it's more like, ""You wanna go to Houston today?"". ""Sure, let's go."". laughter Like very, very spon more spontaneous like, ""You wanna go clubbing tonight? O K, let's go clubbing."". Like so it's different in that aspect like you you can just you ha I feel like there's a lot more freedom to do things. O K. And and in XXX07, I feel the same way. But like just because I'm a guy, but like if I was a girl like it would be a lot different. Like I know a lot of girls who have a lot less freedom when they live back at home. Like in with their families. Like when they're visiting back in XXX07 or wherever. O K. All right. So next role-play. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. <.> O K. O K? So how may I help you? Urm I was hoping to find an apartment close to school. laughter And ur I was hoping to get the cheapest ur price. So urm <.> ur what kind of apartments do you have available mm close to school? Well it's a university town so there's lots of apartments nearby for um living alone or for sharing. laughter O K. Ur I wanna be living by myself. So how much does the how much is your cheapest one-bedroom apartment close to the university? Cheapest one would be three hundred fifty dollars. O K. How far is that from the university? Urm it's a good ten-minute walk. Ten-minute walk? Mm. Is ur <.> is there a lot of parking spaces in the apartment because sometimes there is, you know, not that many. <.> Like for instance, like if a guest came over, is there ur enough parking spaces for the guest, too? Urm Yeah. Lots of open space nearby so you can park there. Urm how big is the apartment? Urm at least like five hundred square feet total. Mm. I mean ur does it have a bathroom? And. Right. Just one bed room and small Bathroom. space. Ur it and it has a bathroom, too? Sure. O K. And a shower? Urm <..> urr when does when is the moving time for that apartment? Urm if you can let us know one month in advance, it could be arranged. Is it urm first story, second story, third story? Urm we have a couple on different floors. So if you want to take a look. O K. Yeah. Yeah. O K. So urm we can set up the appointment, and we'll go up there. O K. All right. laughter That's that's the end of the role-play. Mm. So have you ever considered living alone? I I have over here. Oh . O K. Yeah. Uh-huh. How is that? But. Ur it's it's good. It's urm mm like when I first started looking for an apartment, like ur I ended up having to spend a lot of money on on it because like I ended up looking for the apartment a little bit too late. So like, I ended up having to pay seven hundred twenty-five dollars a month. So and but it was all-bills-paid and it was furnished. But and it was a really big apartment, but and it was close to the university. It was a good apartment, but it was just really too expensive. Hm. So urm like this when I get back to the U get back home this December, urm cough I have to go sign uh I already found an apartment. I have to just go and sign the lease. And it just ur it it's in effi it's an efficiency an efficiency, ur just like a living room space and a bathroom. Mh-hmm. So like it's cheaper. Mh-hmm. Urm and that's like a lot it's a lot cheaper and still close to school. So like I would rather have that. And like my past like in my last apartment, there wasn't enough parking that's why I asked about the parking space. Because I was like I like sometimes came home at night, and there was not parking spaces for me for my for me like so because other people had parking space. They don't have des they don't have designated parking spaces so like a lot of people took my parking spaces or whatever. So like I would have to like park my car like across the street or or park it illegally or something. And wake up early in the morning, and go get my car, and bring it back to the apartment so before I went to school. Before I rode the bus to school because in the University in the XXX08, like everyone rides the bus to school and stuff. Oh I see. Hm. So how did you go about finding that apartment? I just drove around basically by myself. Urm and I went to ur I I at first, I was looking around for mys by myself. And then like I got someone to help me like I went to apartment locator. We went around, too, but like the apartments she showed me weren't all that great. So I just continued on by myself. And I basically just spent uh two days in XXX09 just like driving around. And at Denny's, looking at, you know, apartments and numbers, and calling them, and going over there, and meeting with them, and just looking at the apartments. I had to look at it first before I can before I decide to rent, yeah. O K. One last role-play. Here you go. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. ""Something you need."". Do I have to say what I need? Or. Yes. O K. . laughter cough Anything is fine, O K? O K. All right. Let's start. So can I help you? Yeah. I was ur wondering, urm <.> ur where are the where are the camcorders?. Urm well you have them right there O K. Urm in the glass case. ur can I go ahead and look at this camera? O K. Sure. It's actually the most popular one. Really? Urm what does it do? laughter Well actually the battery lasts long. Oh O K. Yeah. So the batteries. cough Urm how much is it? It's eight hundred dollars. Eight hundred dollars, huh? That's a little steep. Is it ur what does it do that ur the other cameras can't do? Is it just the battery or? Urm well <.> actually, you can urm add the images later on. Mhm. if you're trying to urm picture like . Mhm. Insert some comments and things like that. Mhm. I see. What about the next camera that laughter what are do the other cameras do? Oh well they're all standard cameras. They're all standard cameras? Yeah. Is there anything? Different warrantees and ur just different brands. Mhm. Urm <..> whe urr <..> how long does the battery last? laughter laughter That one? Yeah. Eight-hundred-dollar one? Urm actually four hours. Four hours, huh? . Urm what about this camera right here? How much is this camera right here? Urm that one is six hundred. What's the differen. It's last year's model. That's the difference. What's the difference between this one and ur this other eight-hundred-dollar model? Mm basically the battery. Just the battery? Yeah. Urm. The other one is Sony, this one's isn't. So they do the same function? Oh sure. But that's just a battery? Right. Oh O K. Well I think I'll go ahead and make this I'll go ahead and take this six-hundred-dollar one . Oh O K. All right. So urm I'll wrap it up and ready. O K. O K. Thanks. last role-play. O K. So urm <.> have you ever had any troubles over here finding something? At Akihabara? laughter No, no, no, no, no. In general. Here. Ur in Japan? Urm finding something. Mm not really. Ur like maybe at first when I came to Japan, like uh uh just like not knowing, I guess, where the everything was. But like usually like actually like I did I do have problems when I go into like bookstore, and I don't know like where like certain likes topics are. Mh-hmm. So like usually I'll ask, but cough other than that, like usually bookstore like just because there're just so many topics and like there's like eight stories, and I don't wanna go all the way up to the laughter I don't know. Because you know, and it doesn't have say it in English. So like I'd like describe the topic because I don't know the actual word or something maybe for the topic in Japanese. So er maybe er they're like ""kodomotachi"" laughter like kids or like, you know, something like that. But like <.> mm that is like also like maybe at department stores also. Just like places where there's like eight like there's a lot of stories, and I don't wanna like look for it, you know. So I just ask somebody. But other than that, not really. Urm in general, when you find something that you really, really want, but it's kind of expensive, Mh-hmm. urm how do you make a decision? In general, like if I really wanted it, like if I get like for instance, like a camcorder, like if I went in with the intent to buy, like I would generally buy it just because like I went in with the intention. Like if I'm if I'm going to buy a computer, and I know I'm gonna go and I need a computer, then there's not like I may go to like different stores. But like like I'll check around first. And then like go back to wherever the best deal was. But like if I'm going with the intention to buy it, then I'll buy it. But like cough if like I'm looking around and I see a computer and I think like I want it, and I s I still might need it but like I'm just looking around, and I didn't go in with the intention to buy it, then I won't buy it. Hm. Like I'll wait. But like if I go in with the intent to buy it, I'll probably buy it. O K. All right. And the last thing. Urm picture sequences to show you. O K. O K. If you can make up a story using these six pictures, and start with ""One day last week"". The interviewee is looking at the pictures. laughter Pretty good pictures. Mh-hmm. O K. laughter O K. sigh One day last week, as I was ur walking down with my girlfriend urm can he be I? O K. Can I be the guy? laughter One day, as I was ur walking down with my one day last week, as I was walking down with my girlfriend urm down the street as it was raining. Heard a sound. And I looked down, and my girlfriend was picking up a cat out of the box. Urr the my girlfriend ob ob you know, wanted to take the cat home, but I was like, ""No, that's that's no go."". And but she kept she kept giving me that face that she always gives me. So I was little a bit troubled, but I was like, ""Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's take the cat home."". And she was happy. laughter O K. Thanks. Well End of the story. when you say she made the face that she Always gives? always does, yeah, what do you mean? laughter Like that, you know, the puppy dog face like she in her in that face in the picture, it looks like she's kind of a little bit like she knows that she can get what she wants if she makes that face. laughter So like it's kind of like and that's and he's like, ""Uhh."". He's thinking about whether or not to take the cat home or like you know, he's like he do he doesn't wanna do it, but he loves the girl, you know. And he's with that look that you know, she he knows he can't do anything about it. So so like or something. All right. O K. Well in this kind of situation, Mm. ur <.> and, you know, Mh-hmm. on something, what do you do? If if it was me in the same situation, or? Urm just when you're not agreeing about something with a friend or girlfriend, Urr. Usually. what do you do to resolve that? Well it depends. Like sometimes as far as like it's a dif it it's different with family, and it's different with friends, and it's different with the girlfriend ss obviously. So like uh with family, usually, unfortunately, sometimes it gets to a point where like you're so comfortable and you know that you love each other no matter what, that sometimes you might like say something that's like you don't mean. And like or you're or and plus like you your parents are like, you know, they kind of what they say goes, so you can't really argue with them either. So in that situation, it's kind of like whatever your parents say, and it's kind of like hard to like solve the problem like solve something if you don't dis if you disagree. Urm. How about with the girlfriend? With the girlfriend, it's it dep well I guess I can only say from my own personal experiences that urm ur depending on like this the what the topic is that we're disagreeing on, it usually just depends on the situation. Hard to generalize. Like but like depending on the situation and what we're disagreeing on, like if it's something is as far as like small like as, you know, urr ""You gave me this look,"" ""No, I didn't,"" you know, blah, blah, blah, you know. That's not too hard to deal with. But then like if it gets to a like bigger topic as as uh uh such as, urm <.> ""I have never met your family. Why haven't I met your family?"". laughter laughter You know, those kind of disagreements kind of are a lot tougher to like just you know. Like usually like if if it's like something small as erm like ""You gave me this look, whatever, er yeah, blah, blah, blah, like that is more like I usually be like, ""Oh whatever."". It's no big deal. No problem. You know, but like when it comes to like something bigger and like that's deeply more deeply rooted, those kind of urm problems, like even after talking it out, it's still really difficult to come up with a solution because ur it's really just more deeply rooted than like something you can just say. Hm. It's something you have to kind of do, and it takes a little bit time to get through that certain things. So like those are sort sort of like you kind of like have to say like what the problem is, and then just kind of like give it sometime to be able to solve itself. Hmm. You know, like I mean you have to be aware of the problem, and then just like kind of like to give it time, Mh-hmm. you know. Like some like for instance, like ""You're not romantic."". Like for instance. laughter No, that's not what I mean, you know. laughter laughter Na, err like for instance, I'm just kidding. For instance, if if I was told I wasn't romantic, <.> the next and she can't say the next day to me, ""You're still not romantic."". You know, it's kind of hard to solve it like that. Right. Right. Right. Sure. Yeah. It has to be like, you know, ""You're not romantic."". ""O K. You're right. I'm sorry. I have to admit I'm not romantic."". So you have to give it like maybe, I don't know, a week or two weeks, maybe even ur longer than that. Because if give her her if you give her roses the next day because you I just told you you're not romantic. That's why. laughter Right. Yes. But but like you have to give it time so like you know, and then like if after like a month or so, you still don't see anything, you're still not romantic, then you kind of got ur you know, get into it again. But in those situation, you kind of gotta give it time. Right. That's how I that's how I see it, like it solves itself. O K. Mm-hm. Now, the very last task here. Um another story. cough Again, start with ""One day last week"", please. Mm. The interviewee is looking at the pictures. O K? laughter O K. Ur <.> can do I give these people names or anything? Anyway you like. All right. One day last week, Sally went to the department store to urr to shop for her husband's birthday present. Ur she saw a tie that she liked, and <.> thought that her husband would enjoy the tie as i if it was the present. So she gave the tie to the sales person, and ur had it wrapped. And she paid for it. Urm but as she was leaving the department store, she saw that there was a bunch of sales for they for shoes and for clothes that she thought were pretty nice. So she ended up buying more than she thought that she would buy, and left the department store with mm lots of <.> bags laughter of clothes and shoes that she bought. Mm. O K. Thanks. store, you know. Urm <.> could you tell me the last time you received a birthday gift? The last time I received a gift. Urrr tut I got <.> tut a for my birthday, I <.> I got a Play Station Two from my best friend. And ur I was really surprised actually because urm I may have known her for like eleven or so years, but like she got me, I mean Play Station Two is really expensive so er like was pretty surprised. But she said I was kind of like ur going away to Japan ur slash birthday present slash ""I'm gonna miss you,"" stuff like that. So urrr really was nice. And I think that was back in June. Mhm. I. laughter What was the situation like? She just gave it to you or Oh. did you go out? Well basically she came from well i it was basically I was having a sort of like a get together in XXX09 urm on the weekend. So like she as well as my other best friend, urm that's a guy from XXX11, as well as ur a few other people all came to XXX09 to see me on my birthday. And urm as I was I opened up her trunk, and she gave me like the present. But like I didn't know what it was until <.> like I just brought it out. But eventually like I heard her talking, and just like the way like she was they were talking and like somebody else came over, and she said ur like er ""I don't have any Play Station Two games and da, da, da, da."". And I saw her give her look to that girl, and I was like, ""Oh."". Like I knew ju er for right then and there she gave me a Play Station Two. And I asked my other best friend, I was like, ""Hey, did she give me a Play Station Two for my birthday?"" And then he was like, ""Yeah. I asked her yesterday."". And I was like, ""Didn't know it."". And then my friend's like ""I know you did."" We were both like because she was like she he was like saying, ""I said the same thing when I found out from her."". I was like, ""Get out."". Wow. So we were both a little bit surpri I was really surprised. Yeah. Mhm. great friends. Yeah. O K. Well we're gonna finish up now. O K. O K? Urm are you gonna head back home after this? I'm gonna actually study a little bit more for Jap for I got a test tomorrow. So got a little more studying to do, but yeah. You're already prepared. I hope so. Not really actually. No, not really prepared for that, to be honest. Is it writing? It's an essay. Um I mean it's essay. I don't really know because our teacher really our teachers here really don't tell us what's gonna be on. As as far as like ur in the in the U S, like they usually tell you what's gonna be on the test, or at least, like sort of tell you what is gonna be on the test, or like tell you what might be on the test. But like here, they don't really say anything like as basically anything goes and like anything he mentioned, but he really didn't talk about anything in class per se. So It's a surprise. it's basically I don't know how to prepare for it, and I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna do well so but that's O K. Mm. Well good luck. Yeah. Thanks. O K. And thanks for coming in today. O K. All right? All right.",0

It's quite it's been an adventure. sniff Mh-hmm. I see. Well so what do you usually do here? Er I usually go to Shibuya. Erm but lately the last two weeks, I've been trying to explore, going to Kamakura, Odaiba, er Asakusa. Just as many places as I can around this area, basically.

Do you get together and you go out somewhere sometimes? Erm yeah. Usually, er me, XXX03 and um er o mm the okasan. XXX05 chan w er actually works really late. Hm. Because, I guess, they pay more than other times. So we're kind of a little off-schedule, but we do hang out, like sometimes, a little at the game center and stuff. Yeah. Hm. I see. Mm O K.

And er I do my own personal which I learn on the side or I watch Japanese movies with my host family, and they help me out a little bit in trying to understand that. Mh-hmm. Mh-hmm. But, yeah, I definitely do a lot of studying of Japanese here. Hm. Hm. Why are you so interested in Japanese? Erm at first, it was really just a curiosity Hm. in the language being so different, and er seems so impossible to earn it. But now that I'm here, I'm learning just how important it is to just be bilingual and know other people, languages and you just really have to see like a whole different mindset by learning another language. laughter So, yeah, th that's why I do it now. laughter Hm. O K. I see. Is anyone else in your family bilingual? Erm yeah. My parents were born in XXX06, so they speak Creole and French and English, so laughter they have more of a benefit. I I speak Creole a little bit but my uhh but my French is just not good at all. So I gotta learn. So after I'm done with Japanese, I'll be studying French and Spanish. laughter laughter Yeah. Wow busy. Yeah. Uh-huh. O K. laughter Um so back home, what do your parents do? Hm. My I only live with my mom, Mh-hmm. but erm for a parent, but erm I also live with er I just recently, I like I use I used to live with my two cousins for two or three years. So. Mh-hmm.

So while you are here, Hm. what do you miss about home? tsk I miss er laughter laughter I miss er my campus a lot. I miss my definitely my family. Er I think some other things that I miss are like just feeling at home. Mh-hmm. Erm feeling at home, a lot of American products I miss, actually. laughter Um being able to just pick up anything and read is a big problem I have here. Like I can't read a lot of kanjis and stuff. So sometimes that makes you feel really awkward. Like er like I can't even like read. laughter Hm. You know. Mh-hmm. But, you know, back in America at least mm I can read, you know. laughter Right. So that that's a little bit difficult, because everything's in kanji outside Right. and everything. Sometimes you can be like feel lost, you don't know where to sneeze go. Have you been lost at all? Oh yeah. First two weeks, I was really laughter really lost. Got lost on the trains here and there. Uh-huh. And part of that I guess that was part of the fun a a little bit. But laughter yeah. Er. So what do you do when you get lost? Ohh. laughter Er it was really bad the first time because I didn't exactly erm my host family wasn't around exactly when I was lost, so it was hard to get in contact with someone. But er I had their card showing an address, or I would ask people around where to go. And they got me in the direction, but I couldn't exactly get home for a little bit. So that was really bad. Or I would just get lost on the train. Er I didn't exactly understand the lines and stuff, so I wouldn't know exactly what line to get on. So it was difficult. laughter Quite an adventure. laughter Yeah. laughter O K. Now I'm gonna show you some pictures and Hm. I'd like you to describe what you see here. Let's see. I see um some er ski lodge, I guess. Er there're some kids on the left on having a snowball fight. Erm there are some people skiing down slope. Someone's actually skiing backwards. laughter Way on the right, there's someone that's totally stumbled. And erm I forget how to call these things, but there's this little seating thing where you can go up and down the slopes and stuff like that to view the whole ski lodge. Er there're some people having coffee inside a little cabin. Yeah. O K. Um do you ski at all? I don't know how. So I I no, I I would like to though. laughter laughter Yeah. I'd like to. Never been skiing. But I've had snowball fights. laughter Ah I see. laughter O K. Um so what other sports do you do? Erm I played baseball when I was a lot younger. But now I really just work out at the gym. I consider that my sport. laughter Hmm. Yeah. Wha. Occasiona occasionally play baseball but erm and basketball, too. But mainly I I like to work out in the gym. Why is it important for you to work out? Um it actually it feels good once you get in the rhythm. laughter laughter At first, it kind of hurts and stuff, you get sore. But it actually feels good. And when you start seeing results, you kind of wanna stick to it. Yeah. laughter Er O K. laughter laughter It's it's fun. I I like it. And sometimes you get good notices, so it's cool. laughter laughter Um have you been able to work out around here? Yeah. I just started working back out for about three weeks. Er three weeks now at the XXX04 gym. Ahh. At first, I didn't really know where it was or what it what it had in it. But er yeah, so it's been two months away where I didn't get going back for about three weeks now. So it's really good. Can you tell me more about that gym? Erm it's old. laughter There's um some of the there's there's a decent amount of materials to work out with. Very small. But er things are a little bit narrower than in the U S. The bars are like really like this. So it's really hard for someone of my size to deal with them. Mh-hmm. But er and the seats are a little smaller or or shorter. Everything's a space a short in Japan. But erm the the weights are old and stuff. But, you know, you make use of what you got. sneeze Yeah. Yeah. Hm. Nobody's in there though. It's wired. So laughter in case something happens, Uh-huh. you know, nobody's in there to watch you, so I go with a friend. sneeze Oh I see. Yeah. O K. All right. Next picture. All right? Oh O K. This is like a electronic store, something like Best Buy or laughter maybe something in Akihabara here Mh-hmm. in Japan. But er there's a salesman showing a customer some watches, erm it seems like. And there's in the store, there's cases er and displays of er cameras, camcorders, televisions, stereos, portable Walkmans and telephones. And it's three o'clock. laughter Mh-hmm O K. Um you said it looks like the place called Best Buys. I've never been there. What's it like? Oh it's a in the U S, it's a major Uh-huh. er electronic store. Uh-huh. That's it's very basic warehouse type of thing. And there're all sorts of audios, speakers, SONY, and all the big brands are there, huge T Vs. Yeah. You get all the standard electronics you need. Hm. They're pretty big in the U S. Hm. Actually worked there before. laughter Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. laughter All right. Um you said earlier that, you know, in Japan, everything is smaller and narrower. Right. Other that that, um what differences do you see in like stores here? Ah. Between the States and here. In stores. Er tsk yes. Hmm I know, in terms of like electronic stores, Uh-huh. laughter there's a lot more like technology and a lot more like selection within the brands and stuff. Hm hm. Hm. But I haven I don't know, I haven't seen so many differences in erm actual in stores, actually. There's a lot of nice boutique stores here Hm. like they have in the States. Fancy brands and then there's regular stores like Carrefour, which is comparable to Wal-Mart, something like that. But I haven't seen too many differences. But there's a lot more people doing promotions outside Ah. and stuff like that, giving tissues and paper saying, ""Er."" laughter There's a lot more of that. And like they do that a lot more to get you in the store. laughter Ah. Like they would all, you know, ""Irashaimase"" loud and everything. Yeah. So laughter laughter they do a lot. Customer service probably would be a little bit better, I'd say, here. laughter Erm. It won't . Depending on where you go. Ah. Like no matter where you go, it's like you kind of get some type of good service.

The end of this one. All right. So have you lived alone before? Yeah. In my dorm. laughter Ah. If that counts. laughter I see. laughter Back at school. laughter I have li I have lived alone for a year. laughter Right. Um how was that different from being with your mom or with cousins? Uh eh er. It was different, because everything that was my mess was usually mine. Or it's you that. And sometimes you just need someone to talk to or ask questions or stuff like that. So at times it was hard. And there was just a lot more ""on yourself"" type of thing. A lot more movie watching, I'd say. laughter laughter Because I was actually ki kind of sick at the ti during the time I was living alone, so I actually had to be home a little bit more to heal up. So, yeah, a lot more movie watching, I guess. Developing over yourself as well. cough Yeah. What kinds of movies do you like? Er I like action and I also like dramas. Just maybe something like ""Forest Gump"" or ""Gladiator,"" those type of those type of movies. cough Hm. Um after watching an action movie, Yeah. laughter how do you feel? Acti little little rasher. laughter laughter Little bit of adrenaline goes, I guess. Er ur ur little bit er excitement or or ready to go do something else or Uh-huh. go out or something. I see. Hm. O K. And the last one. Sure. Here you go. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K. So how may I help you? I'm interested in getting a digital camera. Mh-hmm. I'm I know there's all sorts of brands and qualities of you know, of photos and so forth. I wanted to know if you have any recommendations, and if you could try to mm just explain to me the differences between, erm you know, just in terms of clarity and stuff. And I'd like to spend around four hundred dollars, if possible. O K. So for four hundred dollars, I think there are two really popular ones. Hm. Hm. Erm mm what features do they offer? Features. Well um one actually can take movie pictures Hm. for like fifteen seconds. O K. Yeah. The other one, clarity is better. Oh O K. Right. So the other one has a lack of movies? Right. O K. But much better clarity. Well since I'll probably be using the other one for er I probably just use one for the pictures. I have a camcorder. It might make sense to get the one with better clarity. O K. How much is erm memory cost for something like that? Pardon me? The er memory cards for the. Er. Ah O K. Um they are average um maybe mm eighty dollars. O K. Well I plan to take a lot of pictures. So if you could give me the highest card, O K. that'd be great. O K. So, yeah, I'll take that. The one with the better clarity. Right. O K. Right. O K. So that one is um three hundred eighty dollars plus a memory stick. O K. Actually, is is there a warranty available as well? Yes. Oh O K. Excellent. Mh-hmm. So I'll take that. O K. All right. So all together and here you go. Thank you. laughter Thank you. Thanks for shopping here. So that's the end of the role-play. Mm. Interested in digital cameras? Yeah. laughter laughter Yeah, I am, actually. Mh-hmm. Why? I have one and they just. Oh. laughter I I before, I was never even a picture person. Huh. But it's like really convenient to just have it and be able to load it up on your computer. So Right. I like them. And I I don't have to worry about developing them. Uh-huh. I can choose which ones look good and then develop them. So Right. it's it's good, actually. Hm. What got you started? Er just coming here, I I was like, you know, I should get a good camera for er memories and visuals, and I haven't took many pictures really all my life. So it was it was time to start to take pictures and stuff, so I got a digital camera. Hm. And like they're they're very convenient. They're just I can see it's like I can see why I really wouldn't do it before. Oh. But now with the technology, I'm like ""Oh"" jus just right there I know how it looks. If it looks bad, I can take another one. I don't have to guess or anything like that. So that's why. cough I'm not quite sure Sorry. how it works. Oh O K. Uh um what do you mean by downloading? Do you know? Well once y erm each camera, you pu there's a memory card. Uh-huh. So it's not film, it's just a, you know, digital file. So each time you take a picture, it jus you can see it right on the L C D right there. So, you know, i once you do that, you can usually just connect your camera up to your computer, Uh-huh. and the pictures just load onto your computer. And er but some other one, you can just take your card out and put in the computer. But you can just er from there, you could either blend those on to a C D or give them a memory card and they can print out pictures right there. Convenient. laughter Yeah. So it's convenient, you know. O K. Then the next segment. I want to show you some pictures. And Sure. if you can make up a story using these pictures from one to six. And start your story with ""One day last week"". O K. One day last week, er Dan had took his son out to a restaurant erm in Tokyo. And they had erm they had ordered some chicken and er fish, had some beers. Erm his dad son had eaten a sigh uh a lot and the stomach was very full. And after that, his son went off back to back home. laughter O K. laughter Sorry. laughter So could you tell me about your excuse me, Sure. your favorite restaurant um in Tokyo, sniff Ohh a favorite restaurant. if any? Erm I don't know if I have a favorite restaurant, but I have a favorite, I guess, maybe, yeah, it's s it's a sushi place I like. Hmm. Hm. It's out of the all the sushi places I've been to, it's really a good one in Shibuya. There's always a long, long wait for it. So I guess it's really popular. Er sometimes have to wait for like forty minutes to get in there. But ur yeah, it's really fresh, erm really good service er er y yeah, just like really fresh fish, good service, and everything's just nice nice atmosphere as well. Mh-hmm. Has your host father Hm. cooked for you at all? laughter Sometimes. sus sushi se chef. Right. Right. Sometimes he m he bre he makes sushi for me right there. But usually co sometimes he comes home a little bit late, so Oh. by that time, the my okasan usually cooks as well, cooks beforeand. So it's usually my okasan, but sometimes otosan. Yeah. Huh. laughter And how is it? It's good. It's better than my cooking, laughter Uh-huh. which is bad laughter laughter Right. laughter which is bad. Right. So what can you do to make it better? I don't know. It's funny my mom doesn't cook as much since I've left for college. Hm. And my sister left for college prior Mh-hmm. so she just eat all alone. She she's she lived uh she's you know, I only come home during the summer. So she doesn't cook as much because she's not used to cooking as much since we left. So I don't know. laughter laughter O K. laughter I don't know. I have to I ur eh but it's O K. I I can usually find something. laughter And it's a little different, because in the U S, they just buy a whole bunch of food. While here, they buy daily because space being an issue. laughter Oh I see. Right. cough O K. And lastly, <.> this one. O K. Once again, please make up a story. Start with ""One day last week"". One day last week, Mary was looking for a good gift to give her er to give her er husband and to also do so er do some looking around and shopping for herself. So she went into a department store in Shibuya. Erm she looked at she looked through a lot of men's men men attire and she got helped out and saw a tie she actually liked. And since her husband really likes ties, she got tie for him. Erm the tie was about sixty dollars. They wrapped it up for her. And after that, she continued shopping at a at a bargain sale to look for some shoes, and then a and then looking for some dresses and blouses and so forth. And she found a couple of things. And after that, she went off and went back home with the gifts. cough Hm. All right. Are you planning to buy some souvenirs for your family? I have. laughter Yeah? In er Asakusa. Uh-huh. Erm some er some cups like the mace with the mace er designed stuff, Japanese lines. Erm sigh though it's really hard to explain. But er it's i it's like a threaded fabric that you could hang up. Huh. I don't know how to explain that, Uh-huh. what it's called exactly, but it's really nice. Erm some tea er some of the tea in pottery I've brought back. Er my girlfriend back home actually likes Hello Kitty, so I bought some Hello Kitty stuff for her. Erm yeah, but that's pretty much of what I've gotten so far. Er I'd like to bring back some technology but they're really expensive here, so Hm. probab yeah, it's probably just gonna be, you know, standard stuff in Asakusa and in Kamakura. I bought some things from Kamakura as well. Erm chopsticks in the Kamakura-wood type of thing in a Kamakura lug, cough I bought. O K. Other than Hello Kitty stuff, Ah. when you buy stuff for your girlfriend, Ah. how do you usually decide what to buy? sigh It's usually not a big decision process. I'm ur a li it's a little bit random. I actually just if I really if I'm at some place where I feel that I I see that she likes something, Hm. I could get it for her. Or one time or one time, like she might remark that something is nice and Mh-hmm. I'll just surprise her at a at a totally random time when she might not expect that I do. But it's usually pretty random with narrow. laughter I never sometimes I never really know, I just after looking at a couple of stores, I know a place I know I can feel what I should get. Hm. Yeah. cough O K. Um can you tell me about a time that you received a gift Hm. that you really were surprised for it? sigh Urm yeah, I guess, before I left for er to come to Tokyo, like my girlfriend gave me a leather wallet and coat, which was nice. laughter Hm. Yeah, that was really nice. And it had a picture of her inside, so it was good. Oh it's sweet. laughter laughter O K. All right. So um we're getting close to the end of the interview. O K. Hm. Are you busy today after this? Erm I have study for an exam but Hm. not super busy. sneeze What exam? Erm mm Japanese economy. Economy? Yeah. Wow. Really laughter laughter laughter really, it's dreary stuff but no yeah, that's what I have. Other than that, well. sneeze So you're not too interested in No. economics. Not I I think economics is cool but uh it's really a focused class Ah. on particular aspects of the Japanese economy. And I'm not super interested in this. cough Do good. laughter Right, right. I gotta take care of it. Hm. sneeze O K. Do you know what you'll have for dinner? Er hopefully curry rice. Oh. laughter Uh-huh. Hopefully curry rice. My host mom knows I like it a lot. laughter And she hasn't done that for a little bit. And I think she just bought some the other day, so it might be that today, hopefully. laughter Sounds good. O K. So er thank you very much for coming by today. Oh sure. Mh-hmm. Is is that all the questions you need or? Yeah, that's it. Oh O K. That's it. Sure. laughter Thanks, XXX01. Absolutely. Hm.",0
"N_file00018.txt 2002-11-14 male 20 USA 1_12m Psychology ski electric shop train_intermediate travel_intermediate shopping_intermediate stray cat Hello. My name is XXX01. May I have your name for the record? My name is XXX02. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. laughter O K. So er where are you from? I'm from XXX03, XXX04. Mh-hmm. O K. Can you tell me about the area you live in? Um I'm actually not from XXX03. Oh. I'm from XXX05 which is, Mh-hmm. I guess, it's about forty minutes southeast of XXX03, really. Mh-hmm. Erm it's kind of a suburb. It's er it's in the heart of what, I guess, is referred to as XXX06. Mh-hmm. Erm <.> it's a nice nice town. There's two high schools, erm movie theaters, just kind of a standard standard suburb. Mh-hmm. It's nice so I enjoy it. So what brings you here? Erm studying Japanese mostly, Mh-hmm. Japanese culture and mostly Japanese language more than anything. What do you find interesting about Japan? Erm honestly, I didn't think I'd do that much when I was doing my application. Oh. Uh-huh. I had come here in junior high school at the end of junior high school, so between eighth and ninth grade, Mh-hmm. and I did a home stay for two weeks in XXX07 ken. And er I had a really good time. And everybody was really nice and friendly and really welcoming. So when I was looking for a place to study abroad, I figured that this might be a cool place to come. Hm. So that's why I came back. O K. So are you enjoying the classes here? The classes? laughter Yeah. The classes, not so much. I really enjoy erm my life my daily life with my host family Uh-huh. and er my field placement sometimes where I go and do work with XXX08. Mh-hmm. Erm the classes, Hm. they're ve they're very different from what I'm used to back home in America. Right. I see. So. Um O K. S um <.> and so what do you do at that field placement? Erm it's kind of interesting. Half the time, I do probably the most banal office work you could imagine. laughter I just Xerox stuff and I collate stuff and basic kinda intern stuff. Hm. And then the other half the time though, I get to the the XXX08 puts together these programs for visiting international delegates Mh-hmm. from other countries. So for instance, yesterday, there was a group of about thirty Chinese people that were visiting Japan under the auspice of some youth exchange program. And we got to go to Koizumi's office in the L D P building, look around there. We went and did a tea ceremony. And after that, we went to a dinner in Akasaka and er drank a little, ate a little yakitori and the Chinese people were getting up and sing songs, you know, just belting it out. It was really cool. laughter So, yeah, it's fun. Hm. O K. So in your free time, um do you hung out with friends? Here? Yeah. Erm most of the time, I hung out with my host family actually. Mh-hmm. Which I guess, they are friends. Oh O K. Yeah. Mh-hmm. Erm. What are they like? There's my host mother, my host father both of which are both of whom, I think, are around thirty thirty something Mh-hmm. just a little over thirty. And there're three kids. There's a five-year-old, a three-year-old and a one-year-old. Mh-hmm. So things around the house are very interes they're always busy. Mh-hmm. You know, it's there's never any downtime. It's always exciting, laughter playing with the kids and stuff. So that's fun. O K. So um can you describe your room or um apartment that you live? Erm my room has <.> laughter a bed that's pretty low to the ground. Erm I have three really thick sheets on it because the house has no central heating. Hm. So it's freezing when I eat in there and freezing when I wake up in the morning. But I got three really heavy blankets. Erm there's a desk in one corner with er a lamp on it, and all of my stuff piled on top because there's no real storage space to speak of. Erm there's a stereo sitting next to the desk, C D player, some outlets that usually have er the my C D battery charger or my cell phone battery charger plugged in. There's a closet right in front of the bed. And in front of the closet, I usually have piles of my dirty laundry Mh-hmm. or the laundry that just been cleaned and is now waiting to be put back into the closet. And all of my personal stuff like shower stuff, like tooth paste, stuff like that. Mh-hmm. So you listen to a lot of music? Erm yeah. laughter laughter Yeah. But my commute takes about an hour each direction, Ah. so I find myself on the trains a lot, because I'm switching transferring in the stations and stuff. I can't really do homework or anything because there's too much interruption. But I can listen to music pretty comfortably. Mh-hmm. So actually bought a C D player about a week or two after I got here. Hm. And er I've just been bumming C Ds off the friends. So Mh-hmm. yeah, I do listen a lot. laughter What kinds of music? Erm pretty much just whatever comes my way. Like my host parents had a copy of Stevie Wonder's ""Greatest Hits"" laughter which I never really listened to that much before. But I developed a pretty strong taste for it after listening to it for a few weeks. Hm. Erm my cousin sent me kind of a random, folky kind of C D. Er I just borrowed the Beatles from somebody the other day, and my friend just lend me a trance C D, er electronic . And I'm enjoying them now. So Hm. pretty much anything. Mh-hmm. I see. O K. Well I'm gonna show you some pictures now. And this one is the first one. Describe what you see here. Erm it looks like a ski slope. There's er one, two, three, four, five skiers or six, but one of them is taking a spill and he's missing one of his skis and poles. There's a snowboarder at the top of the mountain. There's a child lift on the right. Erm there's a mountain in the background, and some kids having a snowball fight in the foreground on the left. Erm there's a snowman next to, I guess, it's a cat. It's not really snow, powder snow. Crowdy on the front of it. Erm there's a lodge. There's some people that look like they've got a mug of coffee or hot chocolate or something. Erm and right next to the lodge, there's like a ski and snowboard stand, and a mound of snow behind that. And one of the guys is on the other skis. He's a little chubby. He's wearing an orange bib. Erm there's a woman next to him who is not as chubby and is wearing an orange bib. She's in red. She's got pink boots with the lower end buckles, they're cute. Erm in the very front lower right, there's a guy with big ear muffs on. And his back is can't see his front, it's just his back. He's got one hand in the air, and he's wearing a jersey with a white C in the back and a fanny pack. Erm. Hm. O K. I think it's enough. Thank you. Was that any good? All right. So do you do any sports? Erm play soccer, inchmeal soccer back in the States, and American football, flag football, and kayak, I might run every morning, and sail. I was on a sailing team. So. Wow. laughter You do a lot. O K. Um I don't really know what ""flag football"" is. Could you tell me about it or actually, what's the difference between that and regular football? The difference between flag football and normal football is, oh I guess, first of all, it's kind of a peculiarity of United States English that, unlike everywhere else in the world, word ""football"" actually means football. Erm in the United States, it's not at all played with the feet. laughter laughter It's, you know, the the American football. Uh-huh. So flag football versus normal football, the difference is, in normal American football, in order to end a play, someone's usually tackled or is knocked down physically whereas with flag football, you're wearing a belt with a bunch of flags ringed around it. And instead of knocking other person over and tackling them, you just have to pull one of the flags off, and that ends the play. So it's a lot less dangerous, I guess. Hurts less. Hmm. I see. So. Mh-hmm. So um why do you like it so much? Flag football? Mh-hmm. Erm it's a really good way to get out and have fun with your friends. It's erm you know, it's energetic, it's <.> you know, <.> it's athletic. Hm. Something to do on the weekend. It's it's easy. All you need is a ball and couple of flag belts and there's not like a lot of equipment or pads or anything. Erm and it's not like really hugely competitive like it's just kinda for fun. Mh-hmm. O K. Next picture is this one. Describe what's in it. Er it looks like a e electronic store. Mh-hmm. There's a guy in a green jacket with a name tag on. And it looks like he's gesturing to a customer who's wearing well looks like a denim jacket and er some kind of cuffed pants, like jeans or something. Erm customer has his left hand in the air, and he's got his finger pointed at something, maybe the salesperson. Erm behind them, there's glass cases filled with telephones and video cameras and there're more photographic cameras. And on top of the display cases, there are televisions, erm and big sound systems, the speakers and dials and cassettes and all that kind of stuff. And on the back of the wall, there's a clock that reads three o'clock. Hm. O K. Are you usually a careful shopper? No. Not at all. laughter I'm not much of a I'm not much of a shopper really. Oh. O K. Yeah. Right. But when you have to buy something, er let's say, it's really expensive, Yeah. Erm what do you consider? I guess if I know I'm gonna have to buy something expensive, I try and I guess I'll look into it a little bit, I try and make sure I don't just buy er something that's gonna break, you know, almost I look for durability and quality. Like I'll look for reviews and I'll ask my friends who'd bought something similar what they think of, you know, whatever they've got, that kind of thing. So <.> yeah. laughter Mh-hmm. Have you had any troubles here With like stuff I bought? with stuff that you bought here? Not really. I haven't bought anything. Oh. laughter Except for that C D player. Oh. It's holding up really well. So. Oh. Uh-huh. It's only been two months so I would hope so. Uh-huh. laughter O K. Um where did you buy that C D player? Erm to be honest, I don't know the name of the store. My host parents were just driving around with me one day, and er we stopped in some place. I thought that might be a good idea to get one. And I got it there. It was kind of in and all-purpose department store with a bunch of floors, you know. So. Hm. All right. So now, we're going to do with you role-plays. All right? Yes. And I'll give you a card. If you could read it. And let me know when you're ready. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K? May I help you? Yeah. I'm trying to get to New York. Mh-hmm. And I was wondering when the next train is and how much it costs. Well the next one is leaving in fifteen minutes. Uh-huh. Mh-hmm. And it's fifty dollars one way. O K. And what platform is that leaving from? Fifteen. Okey-dokey. Can I have one ticket, please? Sure. Thank you very much. O K. Um actually, the next train is all booked. Oh I'm sorry. Yeah. Erm when's the first available ticket that you have? And the one after that which leaves in about twenty-five minutes. . Can I get a ticket for that? O K. Do you accept credit cards? Yes. Fantastic. O K. So here's one ticket. Thank you. Nice trip. That's the end of this role-play. All right. Um so when you go to places outside of Tokyo, Mh-hmm. how do you usually go there? Usually by train. In fact, always by train. Mh-hmm. Yeah. Have you had any troubles getting around? Not really. Erm usually if it's somewhere like really remote, I would talk to somebody either here or my host parents or whoever I'm going to meet in that location. And I'll ask how to get there basically. So they'll tell me what stations I need to transfer at and what lines I need to take. And er that one is just a matter of following the directions. So Mh-hmm. it's pretty simple. Hm. How about when you were in XXX04? I always drove. Huh. I haven't really ridden a train. laughter It's quite . So yeah. All right. Do you find that one is more convenient than the other? laughter Yeah? Yeah. Certainly. Erm one of the things I miss the most is actually being able to drive, you know. Right. Just to have enough freedom of being able to go anywhere you want, whatever you want. laughter Erm through the weekend, we went clubbing in Shibuya. And the trains stop running at twelve. Uh-huh. So at that point, you're out Right. until six in the morning, Right. which kinda sucks. laughter So. It'd be nice to be able to drive and get back. Sure. So. So what did you do after trains had stopped? We just had to wait. We just went into a Yoshinoya and sat down. And killed time for couple hours before the trains started up again. Uh-huh. So. O K. All right. The next role-play is er this one. . The interviewee is reading the card. O K. Ready? Yeah. Oh O K. May I help you? Yeah. I'm er I'm planning a trip abroad. I'm taking some time off from work. Erm and I've got an idea about the holiday but I don't really know where to go. Mh-hmm. I'm kind of looking for a tropical vacation. Do you have any packages or any deals that you offer that I might be able to like get in on? Sure. Of course we have lots of packages. What can you suggest? Tropical islands, did you say? Tropical islands, yeah. Mh-hmm. Um how about Tahiti? Tahiti? Yeah. How much would that cost? And how long would it be for? Right. Um just airfare? Er airfare and stay accom O K. All together? with room and board, yeah. Yeah. Well for er five nights, six days, it would be twelve hundred dollars. Five nights, six days, twelve hundred dollars. O K. Do you have any other, maybe, less expensive options? O K. Er maybe Guam would be cheaper. Guam? Yeah. Yeah? laughter Er how are the accommodations on Guam? Er well there're budget hotels. So that's why the cost would be cheap. And how much would it cost for about a week? About a week? Um. With airfare? Right. About eight-fifty. Eight-fifty? Yeah. Well that sounds pretty good. Uh-huh. Erm what would it take to make reservations for that? Um well you just have to let me know two weeks prior to departure. O K. Good deal. Erm may I have your phone numbers so that I can give you a call back later? Sure. Is here is my card. and you could call me back. O K? All right. Thank you very much. All right. Thanks. this role-play. All right. So um when you decide to travel, how do you usually plan your trips? Erm well actually I'm in the middle of that right now. Oh. Actually I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna do this coming spring semester Uh-huh because I'm gonna take it off from school. Mh-hmm. And erm when you're a kid, you kind of take it all for granted, you know, like your parents plan everything and you're like, laughter ""Oh this is easy."". You just go somewhere. Hm. But now I'm finding a lot harder. I guess what I've been trying to do is the least planning possible. So for instance, erm I know I wanna go to New Zealand. Mh-hmm. So I think I might just go to New Zealand and rent a car and just drive around, basically. And, you know, hike and just go see whatever sights I can and not make a whole lot of arrangements with hotels and stuff that I . Hm. So I guess I kind of opt out of making travel plans, Mh-hmm. basically, like I just try and get somewhere Mh-hmm. and give myself whatever I need to get around that location. Right. So. That makes more interesting. laughter Yeah, maybe. Uh-huh. We'll see. All right. So um if you don't mind, why did you decide not to well to take time out from school? Erm <.> I had some credits going inter school. Mh-hmm. So that I've got that leeway where it's not gonna mean I won't graduate with my class. And I see. um got some money I saved up from working a couple of summers. So I've got the money to do it. And erm I figured that there're not gonna be a whole lot of other opportunities, you know, to just travel around for four or five months without any responsibilities. So might as well take value about it. laughter I see. O K. O K. Now the last role-play. Saying you're not much of a shopper, but laughter laughter let's do that. The interviewee is reading the card. Yeah. I'm er I'm looking for some oatmeal. Do you like do you guys carry oatmeal? sigh Yes. Er what kind of oatmeal do you have here? Do you have Quaker? Do you have rolled oats? We have both. Wow. O K. And where can I find those? What aisle is that on? Ah number ten. Aisle number ten. Yeah. Do you have a whole lot of flavors, you know, like cinnamon raisin and stuff or you only have the plain kind? No, we have a whole range of er flavors. And we also have like the natural type without er leached oats. Without leached oats? Uh-huh. Fantastic. Erm great. And do you sell in oak or do you just have the the small packages? Actually, there're some are on sale now. So if you buy three of them, you get one more free. Fantastic. Is there any limit to the amount I could buy? Like if I buy six, do I get two free? Actually you do. Fantastic. Yeah. Then erm I'm just gonna go easy on over there and get those oats. Thank you very much for your help. O K. Sure. Spend time at laughter Oatmeal, all right? Um I'm sure you don't have oatmeal while you're here. Actually, I've been eating it everything for lunch for about a week. You're kidding. Really? Yeah. Oh. I see. So it's . laughter Is there a reason why? Er I really like oatmeal. Uh-huh. That's it, basically. Oh and it's cheap in the cafeteria here and er it's kind of good food when it's really cold out outside. And the hot water dispensers which they make are really convenient. You know, they have tea machines Right, right. with the ocha and the hot water and the cold water, makes it really easy. Hm. So yeah. It's kind of sad, but I'll be leaving them, you know. laughter Uh-huh. Hm. How are you enjoying Japanese food? Erm it's good. It's really different. Erm even beyond just like the obvious differences like we don't eat so much soba or udon in the United States, there're just like interesting ways that food is prepared. Like for instance, fruit always seems like it's peeled, like apples or nashi the apple-pears or erm grapes, even, are always peeled. And then in United States, that's not so much the case. Whereas with meat, for instance, chicken, when you go to like yakitori or something, they have big strips of fatty skin just hanging off that . And er in the United States, it's always clipped off there. So it's interesting that, for instance, food is peeled whereas chicken fat isn't. And in the United States, we don't peel the fruit so much. Hm. And then I guess there're the obvious like reasons for that like in each culture. Like my host mother was telling me that erm I guess there were some problems with like parasites or contaminations on the fruit fields back, so they started really heavily waxing some of the fruit. So if you just eat it straight, then it's probably not such a good call. So it make sense to to peel it in this context. But anyway, I'm doing a food journal. laughter O K. All right. The food's good. Uh-huh. In general, when you are served something that you're not quite crazy about, Yeah. um how do you deal with it? laughter I pretty much always <.> eat some of it Mh-hmm. just er eat some of it, Uh-huh. and then if I really, really don't like it, I just don't finish it, like I don't eat all of it. Hm. Erm for instance, when I was in Kyushu, they had us eat raw horse liver. Hm. But they they realized that it was something that we didn't usually eat, so they weren't really expecting me Hm. just to er to down the whole plate by myself. I think it's only to give you an experience of trying it. Mh-hmm. So I tried it, and I had a piece or two. And then, that was it. Hm. Erm yeah, I generally try new stuff. And sometimes that actually works out pretty well. Like when I first got here, one of the first breakfast I had was natoo, the fermented soy beans, which is tough or little shock to western diet. And er but in Kyushu, again, I was served those for breakfast one morning. I found that I actually didn't dislike them. Hm. And so over a week, I just kept eating and I kept eating and now I actually enjoy them. So I just kinda stick with it until I had to get used to it or pass up. So. Hm. I see. Yeah. By the way, what's raw horse liver like? laughter I've never had it. It's er omoshiroi. It's laughter it's really kinda tsk it's not crispy, but like you bite into it and there's like a little crunch Oh. and er it's kinda sweet, almost. It's it's a lot different than like chicken livers, I think it's kind of tough. Hm. It's er it's not bad. laughter Hm. laughter O K. Now in final stage, I'll show you some pictures and I'd like you to make up a story. Um pictures go this way, and this happened last week. So if you could start your story with ""One day last week"". One day last week, er Jim and Christine were out for a walk. And it was raining, so they brought their umbrellas with them. And they were walking and talking. And suddenly Jim heard a noise, and it sounded like a cat meowing. So he turned around, and there lying in front of the telephone post was a box. And he opened up the box, and Christine took a small cat from inside the box. And she asked him if they could keep it. But he was really opposed to the idea, that wasn't enough for them in the apartment, she just had a baby, thought they'd be really busy, plus there's like disease that cats carry that sometimes infects babies and they die. And he thought it'd be really bad scene if they kept the cat. But Christine's really affectionate towards the cat and seemed like she loved the cat a lot, so Jim's kind of confused and didn't know what to do, erm to take the baby or the cat. And in the end, he decided that it would probably work out O K if they brought the cat home. So they walked home in the rain with the cat. O K. Do you have any pets back home? I had a cat until about a year and a half ago. Hm. And then he died. Hmm. And he was diabetic, which I didn't even know that cats could get. Right. And er what else? Oh when he was incontinent, so he would he even we let him inside the house. He would just go buck wild and he ate up everything. So ultimately he became a outdoors cat, which was kinda a sad deal. But I think he still had a good time as far as cats go. Mh-hmm. When you found out that um he had diabetes, Yeah. how did you have to take care of him? Erm basically, we didn't really change our treatment on him or we didn't really give him any shots or anything. Erm I think we changed the cat food that we were feeding him. But other than that, we really didn't have to do anything too crazy. He lost lost a lot of weight. But otherwise seemed to be pretty good up until when he died. Hm. By the way, I didn't ask you about your family. Um laughter laughter I asked you about your host family. But um Yeah. can you tell me a little bit about them? Erm my dad is fifty something. Mh-hmm. Er my mom is fifty something, too. laughter And they own a small internet publishing company Hm. in XXX09 which is strictly in XXX05. It's about a four-minute commute from the house, which is nice for them, I imagine, seeing as how my host father here deals his an hour and a half commuting to Tokyo everyday. So they're lucky for that. Erm my sister goes to school at XXX10, which is an all-girls college in XXX11. Erm she is twenty-one. And she'll be graduating this coming spring. She is a math and economics major. Erm and two days ago, she got into a car accident where their car tire blew out. And she rolled the car into the median strip. But she ended up with just a cut under her nose even though the car was totaled. And she's O K, so that's good. Hm. O K. laughter So what did your parents say when um you said you wanna go to Japan? Not much. They didn't have a whole lot of input, really, Oh. to it. I mean they were supportive, Uh-huh. but just <.> yeah, they didn't um they've only been here er they've only been to Japan once. Erm they had some kind of sailing match in Kamakura. Uh-huh. So they had a really good time there. And I think they stayed at like a ryokan or something. And er really enjoyed themselves. Uh-huh. So they were only here for, I guess, oh would've been like a long weekend or something. But they really didn't have that much to say about it, you know. They knew it was interesting. My sister has been here two or three times herself, and I'd come here before. So it wasn't like it was totally an unknown element. They just personally didn't have much input on it. Hm. So you have a few weeks left, right, before going back to the States? I've got about six weeks. Oh yeah? But I'm not going back to the States. Oh. I'm gonna miss mic meet, little of that, laughter er my sister in Thailand and a friend of ours Oh hm. Uh-huh. mutual friend of ours. And er travel around and do a charter in Phuket which might be a bad idea given the recent warnings that have come out about that area. But we'll try to stay away from the clubs and the touristy spots. And I think we should be O K. Hm. So it should be fun. Hm. O K. Well we're gonna um wrap up here. Oh. And um is there anything else that you're definitely gonna do before you go to Thailand? Erm we're going to Kyoto and Osaka on the Shinkansen this weekend. Actually we're taking an overnight bus on the way there, which Uh-huh. should be interesting if I can sleep. laughter Erm what else? There's a really, really big electronic music concert in the Makuhari Messe Mh-hmm. in the middle of December. And I'd really like to go to that if I get the chance. Erm it's a little expensive, works out to be about fifty-five dollars U S. Hm. Fun. Hmm. But it should be a really good show. So I'm probably going to it anyway. Erm what else is going on? Oh we're going to er Nikko at the end of this month around Thanksgiving. Looking forward to that. That should be cool. And er I'm taking a test next Friday. So. laughter What subject? That's the only thing that's on my mind. It's er it's on the ""Tale of Genji"" in Japanese arts and society. It's just kinda for this Uh-huh. Japanese culture. So it should be good. Hm. Did you have to read a summary about the novel or? We actually read the first thirteen chapters on it. Oh you did. In English. Uh uh-huh. Well. laughter Definitely in English. Obviously. O K. So erm yeah. Hm. Good luck on that. Thanks very much. O K. And er enjoy the rest of your stay. Thank you.",0
"N_file00019.txt 2002-11-18 female 21 USA 1_12m Business-Economics room neighborhood landlord_beginner travel_beginner shopping_beginner zoo grocery store Yeah. Let's begin. My name is XXX01. Mm. Can I have your name, please? XXX02. Ur can I call you XXX02? Yeah, sure. O K. All right. How are you today? Good. Good. Fine, thanks. All right. So ur how long have you been in Japan? Urm I've been in Japan for four months. I came August twenty-third. Mm-hm. So ur no, three months, and I'll be leaving December twenty-third. So it'll be four months. Oh. O K. about that I'll be in Japan. Mhm. Yeah. How do you like living here? Urm it's fine. The commute is kind of hard because it's really well I live in XXX03 so it's I have to take a bus and walk er and take a train also. So it takes a long time. But urm besides the commute, urm it's kind of it's k ur I guess for me, I adjusted pretty quickly because urm I have a lot of exposure to like Japanese um customs and stuff. So it wasn't like too much of a shock for me. So I didn't really have a problem adjusting. So it's O K. Yeah. Mhm. So why have you been exposed to this kind of culture? Ur because my grandmother, well my parents also, they are all from Taiwan. And so my grandmother had Japanese education when she was young. And so she also knows how to speak Japanese. And um like I eat a lot of Japanese food at home because she knows how to cook it, and we go out to restaurants a lot. And there're I I live in XXX04, and where I live, there is a lot of um Asians like Chinese, and there is a lot of Japanese people, too. So in that way, like I'm able to be like around Mhm. like Japanese customs and things a lot. Mm. O K. And you mentioned commuting is really hard. Mm-hm. Ur could you tell me more about the trouble you're having? laughter Yeah. Urm well s from my house I live homestay. From my homestay to the train station, it's about a thirty-minute bus ride depending on traffic. Like sometimes it's shorter, but usually it's longer. And then from the train station, I take twenty minute ur twenty minutes on the train to XXX05 Station. And then from there, I walk for another twenty minutes. And so I spend like an hour and a half commuting everyday back and forth. So it takes a long time. But but when I go to Tokyo, it's closer, I think. So that's kind of nice because only about twenty, twenty-five minutes away by train. So yeah. But to school, it's kind of laughter hard. laughter But you get used to it. laughter Yeah. O K. And ur are you living with your host family or? Yes. I'm living with a host family. Mhm. Urm it's mo one mom and ur I have a host sister. Hm. I actually have two, but the older one doesn't live at home. So it's just urm the three of us. Mh-hmm. So it's kind of nice. Urm it makes things simple. laughter Yeah. . Please tell me more about the host sister? Ur she's seventeen. She's in high school. Urm let's see. laughter Ur she's pretty I guess urr like you you mean like what Yeah. what? What kind of person is she? Oh O K. What do you usually do with her? Uh-huh. Urm well I have a I actually have a si real sister who's seventeen. And they actually have the exact same birthday. Oh. laughter Like my host sister and my real sister have exact same birthday, same year. So that's kind of urm weird. But, yeah, so I guess because we are four years apart, I'm twenty one, so like I have stuff to say to her, but not that much. Because we're still kind of different, I guess. She's still but, I think, to me, she's still very much a teenager, and um very much like high school girl kind of, you know. sniff So but we go out I've been out with her a couple of times. Like we went shopping and stuff. But I think it's harder when we talk to her because um like her Japanese is really fast and it's usually ca casual Japanese. So then then it's hard for me to understand sometimes. And then like it's easier a bit for me to talk to my host mom because she she know she tries to speak slow I think she tries probably tries to spea speak slower. And then when she knows that I don't understand, she'll like repeat stuff. But then I think my host sister probably gets inpatient if if I don't know what she's talking about. So that's kind of harder. But otherwise she's really she's nice. Mm. Yeah. She's really nice. She's really sweat. So. Mm. Hm. O K. All right. So first thing today, please look at this picture, and please describe this picture. O K. O K. Ur it's a room with it's a girl's room. And um there's a lot of electrical equipment, computer, typewriter, stereo. Urm she has two pets, like dog and a cat. And the door is opened. Ur it's June, I guess, because there's a calendar which says June. Urm mm err it seems kind of crammed because there's a lot of stuff. Erm like you mean just like the appearance or Mhm. eh just anything? O K. Yeah. Ur ur there is a window with orange curtains and the cat is sleeping on the bed. Urm the girl is wearing a green sweater with blue uh with blue skirt. Urm ur the carpet's kind of yellow. Urm it's eight-forty-five laughter laughter O K. on the clock. All right. O K, that's fine. O K. laughter All right. So do you have your own room now? Ur at my host family's house? Yeah. Yes, I do. Mm. Ur could you tell me about your room? Urm it's s it's smaller than my room at home, but then most houses here are smaller. Urm I have a bed and a really, really small desk that I can't do anything on, so I don't study there because too small. And then I have a really small closet. Urm it's hardwood. Mmm i it has a sliding door that leads out to a pa patio or a balcony. Urm it's it's pretty nice room. Urm curtains are blue. Urrr I have a small small portable T V. Hm. And urm let's see. Urr I have like two dressers. And. Mmm. Mm. Eh. O K. So why don't you study in your room? Oh urm because usually ur because the de O K, for one, the desk is too small, and two, usually they don't keep the heater on in all of the house. So it's cold. So then I study in the living room because they keep the heater on there. Urm yeah, and usually if I study Japanese, I have my host mom help me. So I study there and I watch T V while I do my homework. Hm. So I don't really study in my room. Mhm. Yeah. O K. All right. And does your host sister have her room, too? Yeah. She has her own room, and urr it's pink it's very pink. Everything is pink. She likes pink a lot. laughter And she has a lot of Winnie the Pooh stuff. laughter Urm a lot of pictures. It's a cute room. It's really cute the way she decorated there. And she has like but she has a rug so it's not as cold in her room. And then I have like a bed-bed, like it needs a futon on top of the bed. But her and my host mom both just sleep on the floor on a futon. Hm. So yeah. And then she doesn't have a desk. She just has like a small table in the center. So and then she has like a lot of girl things. Mhm. You know, like, yeah, posters and stuff. She likes Ayumi. laughter So. Ah I see. Yeah. Do you like her, too? Urr I think she's O K. I've only heard of few of her songs. So yeah. So. Mhm. Mm. All right. And do you go to school i in XXX04, do you go to school from your ur parents' house? Urm in XXX04, I live in northern XXX04 near XXX06. And I go to school at XXX07 in XXX08. And driving, it's six hours, so no. laughter I so at school, urm I live in apartment Hm. with my roommate. And so from school, I live about like maybe driving five minutes away from school. But I parking is really, really hard to get at school so then we usually take the campus shuttle to school which takes about fifteen minutes. Hm. Urm so it's pretty um convenient. But where I live is really expensive. Hm. Like the near school, the apartment rent is really expensive. Yeah. So. I see. Ur please tell me about your roommate. Urm my roommate is my friend from high oh no, from I knew her since sixth grade. Wow. Yeah. Sixth grade in elementary, so sixth grade. And so I've been friends with her since and went to junior high and high school together. And then we went to college together. And the first year I was at school, I didn't room with her. Because I thought maybe it'd be better to not room with a friend, like room with someone random. Second year and this is when we lived in the dorms, and second year, urm we decided to live together in the dorms. And then after the third year, we moved out into apartments. And then so we lived together. Then and then the forth year we moved to another apartment, and we live together. So she's really I think she's really easy to get along with, easy to live with. Because we're both kind of the same like like to keep things clean and ur we kind of have the same interests like goin going out and stuff. Urm she she is studying um computer science and computer science and engineering. Urm she's tall. laughter laughter She's really tall and skinny. laughter Hm. And ur she's also Chinese like I am. Urm what else? Urr she has a boyfriend. laughter laughter I don't know. She's twenty-one like me. Uhm. Yeah. laughter O K. All right. Thank you very much. Uh-huh. O K. Here's next picture. Please describe this one. O K. It's really it's sunny. It's ur it looks like a nice neighborhood. Urm there's a cat ur cat and two dogs. There's kids playing.

Urm the city I live in is called XXX09. And it's a relatively small city, but it's urm it's I think it's pretty and then like the housing or everything is pretty the land there is pretty expensive. So it's a pretty urm ex I guess, expensive city. And there's ur there's only a few high s there's a few high schools and elementary schools. And cough it's really it's really small. Like you can get from one side to the other side driving in ten minutes. So it's really small. Urm but it's really convenient because there's like you drive anywhere and there's supermarkets and everything. There's a junior college there. Urm what else? The roads are pretty well paved. Uhm. And urm where I live is more on the edge of the city. And it's more er like at the bottom of right before you go up a mountain kind of thing. So it's kind of like up there, out there. Urm what else?

So Mm. what do people enjoy most on Saturdays and Sundays? Urm mm. Maybe where I live, there's it's near like ur a dam, I guess. Like a reservoir reservoir. And so a lot of people ride bikes up the path up the mountain. They ride bikes on weekends. I see people with like go fishing, go fishing there. Hm. Urm so I think that the reservoir area's sort of place where people can go and relax on weekends. Or mm people go shopping at the the malls.

Urm we wanted a two-bedroom apartment, but the area that we were looking at, all two-bedroom apartments started from really high. The rent was too high. So we settled at the one-bedroom apartment. And we actually we actually looked at a lot of the apartments. And we as soon as we saw that one, we liked it, because it was it was um newly remodeled. So they repainted the apartment and the carpet was new, and all the appliances and the kitchen were new. So the apartment was just looked really new to us. And there's really big windows and the balcony so then um it's really bright. But I mean it's the apartment's kind of small, but then the urm all those other things and the rent was O K was the reason why we decided on that apartment. I see. Mm-hm. Well you found a nice place.

Like urm they had special deals that urm that make it two per for us. Ur we did wet snorkeling. What else? We went to a luau. Mmm Really. yeah. So it was pretty fun. Mhm. O K. So ur what is the most interesting thing you saw in Hawaii? Urr saw? Mm. Maybe er probably the luau because I've never been to one before. So that was that was pretty fun. Yeah. Like urm there, people perform and stuff and it included dinner and then we kind of got dressed up and stuff. Really. So it was fun. Yeah. That was that was pretty interesting. So. Mm-hm. O K.

This is the end of the role-play. So have you done a lot of shoppings in here in Japan? Ye yeah. laughter Hm.Yeah. I ha have. But it's pretty relatively expensive Hm. compared to the United Stat well yeah, some of the s there's really expensive things, and there's also places where we can go where it's less expensive. So sniff when I go to the really expensive places, I just window-shop. Mhm. Yeah. But urm yeah, I like the shopping here because there're so much and there's a lot of variety. Mhm. So I always see something new. It's always interesting to go shopping. It's not like in America, there's only like few malls. And it's always the same thing, you know. Mm. So yeah. So where is your favorite place to shop? Uh ur here? Mm-hm. Urm I like I like urm Okachimachi Oka ur Ueno or something. Oh laughter uh-huh. Yeah. There's uh Hm. the street where there's a lot of small stores and then there's a uh Abu-Abu, I think, store department store. Hm. I like it there because there's a lot of young people stuff. And it's relatively it's pretty um good, reasonable price prices. Mhm. So I like going there. laughter Wow interesting. laughter Yeah. So what is the best thing you bought so far? Urrr urm I bought well I kind of stay away from the clothes because I the clothes here are really small. laughter laughter They're really small size for skinny girls. So ur mostly like ur I bought purse which I like a lot. So probably that. But I also buy things that we can't really find in the S United States. Like they have really pretty origami paper. And like rice paper were really, really pretty. So I bought some stuff like that. And like ur omiyage for my friends. Urm oh I like the I think I like the makeup a lot more here than in the United. There's more variety. Really? Yeah. Definitely. So yeah. I yeah, I can spend forever in those stores that sell makeup and stuff. laughter laughter Are there more variety here? laughter I think so. It seems like it. Like there's a lot more different brands. Uh-huh. I mean I haven't heard of most of them. But they have expensive brands like the departments brands. But they also have like in drug stores and stuff. But they have to me, it seems like they have a lot more variety here. Yeah. I see. Interesting. I haven't Yeah. noticed it. laughter O K. All right. So here's another one. No, no, no. Finished. O K. Ur. All right. So lastly, Mm-hm. mmm this is a picture sequence. There're four pictures. One, two, three, four. Yeah. And please tell me what's happening. O K. In one, they're going to the zoo urm a guy and a girl are going to the zoo. And they look happy about it. Mhm they get to the zoo, and they're looking at a lion in a cage. And the guy is pointing at it, showing the girl, and he's talking about it. Mhm and then the next thing animal they look at is the monkey. The monkey's sitting on the branch, eating a banana. And the girl is eating a frozen yogurt. And they look happy. And the guy is talking. And then they leave the zoo. And the zoo has closed the gate. It's closed. And they say, ""Bye."". Mhm. O K. All right. So have you been to the zoo in Japan? No, I haven't. Uh-uhm. No, mhm O K. So what is I think in this story, they're having a date. Uh-hm. So what is the most typical date for college students in XXX04? Probably the most typical would be urm go to movies and then or dinner and a movie, is probably is probably the most common especially if it's like the first date or something. You go to nice restaurant to eat dinner and afterwards, you go watch a movie together. Hm. I think it's probably the most typical. I see. O K. So have you found a nice restaurant in Japan? Urr <.> I a restaurant that I like would I like the Italian restaurant in Prena like Capricciosa or something. Hmm. It's a chain, I think. Hm. But I like it because it's not really like a really nice restaurant. It's more casual. But the atmosphere is kind of nice. Hm. So I think that's that would be a nice place to go. Mhm. Yeah. Ur do you see any differences between Japanese Italian restaurant and American Italian restaurant? Ur yeah. I think definitely the food. I actually like the food the Italian food here better because it's lighter. It's not so rich and creamy. And like but too not salty. And so the taste is lighter. Urm usually in America, in Italian restaurants, you order single serve it's like you order for yourself, whereas at that restaurant in Japan, um you order and you share. But they have restaurants like that in America, too. Just not as common. Urm oh they give you urm coffee or tea afterwards. Hm. Like it comes with the meal. And that never happens in America. Yeah. Y yeah. But then on the other hand, if you order coffee in America, you get refills you can get refills for just like the regular coffee, whereas in Japan usually there's no refills or anything. Urm so I guess that's those are some of the differences. Mhm. Oh and well where I live in America like XXX04, you can't smoke insi indoors in any restaurants. Any anything, you can't smoke indoors. So that's a big difference. Like here, you can smoke anywhere. So then it's it's kind of yeah, that's a big difference. Mhm. What do you think of the people who smoke in the restaurant in Japan? Urm well I guess it's not really a big problem. But it's I think it's kind of hard on people who don't smoke. Because you have to be breathing. Other people smoke while you're eating, and it makes the food taste bad. So I don't really like it. But urm I mean they have like smoking sections and non-smoking sections. But it doesn't really help because smoking is right next to the non-smoking. There is no divider. So I think it would is probably good if urm they went towards not smoking indoors or having like really separated sections. Mhm. O K. Yeah. All right. So the last picture. Can you please look at this picture? There are six pictures this time. Uh-huh. And please make up a story based on these six pictures. And please start your story with ""One day last week"". O K. One day last week, urm a woman looked into her refrigerator and saw that it was there was no food. It was completely empty. So she decided to go to the supermarket. So she drove her car to the supermarket, urm and did her grocery shopping. And she bought some cereal, it looks like, and her cart was pretty full. And then she went to the to the checkout the cashier to to pay. And so the cashier ran every all of her food up, and she paid her money. And she packed it up in bags and packed in her car. And then she went home, and cooked an egg and some soup. Mm. laughter O K. All right. Thank you. Uh-huh. Do you sometimes cook here? Ur here, not really. Urm I cooked once for my host family. I cooked some spaghetti. laughter Because because that's like, yeah, I I. But urm I cook at ho urm at school. Because when I live in the apartment, I have to cook by myself. And it's really where I live is really expensive to go out to eat all the time. Mh-hmm. So yeah, I cook more of ur at my apartment usually. So in your apartment, what kind of things do you cook? Usually, sort of ur simple. I guess usually s stir-fry. I stir-fry um Chinese food. And pasta's pretty easy, too. So usually that and rice. I have a rice cooker. Hm. So make things as simple as possible. Mm. So do you cook with your roommate? Ur u well our schedules are u different a lot. So usually we don't cook and eat together. Once in a while, we do. But usually not. Usually we just cook for ourselves. Mhm. Mm-hm. Have you ever had a problem with your roommate? Urr not not especi not really no, not really big problem. Maybe the only thing I can think of would be like her keyboard of her computer is really loud. laughter So sometimes when I'm trying to sleep at night, you can t you can really hear her keyboard. And that makes me not able to sleep. But otherwise, no, not really. No problems. I think we live together pretty well. So what is the secret of keeping a good term with a roommate? Mhm. May urm I think mo I think it's mainly based on mainly depends on the people, I guess. Like if you're really like compatible, and if you sort of have the same kind of living habits, that's probably the only way. Because it's hard if you're completely opposite. Like one person's really messy, one person's clean, it's hard to it's hard to um get somewhere in between like compromise. Usually so usually I think it has to be between the people. If they st already started out being um like pretty easy to live with, like the two of them, pretty compatible, I think that's probably, yeah. Hm. Yeah. O K. And you mentioned the area where you live near the campus Mm-hm. is a kind of expensive area. Uh-huh. But ur is there any good restaurant in the area? Urr cough let's see. Yeah, there are. Urm I'm trying to think of one. Urr there's some Italian restaurants that are pretty nice. And there's also Chinese restaurants, but I haven't been to them. Because I think they're they probably wouldn't be that good. And they have this one street near where we live where they have a lot of Japanese restaurants. So they have like a good ramen place. Hm. Urm yeah. Ye yeah. O K. Uh-huh. All right. So have you tried Japanese food here? Ur yes, I have. Like my host mom cooks Japanese food most of the time. So and I like it a lot. I like all Japanese food like sushi. I eat pretty much everything except for natto. laughter Yeah. Why don't you like it? I don't know. I can' I tried it, and I tried to eat it. But I think it's I think it's probably the smell that I can't that I can't take. Yeah. Mhm. What's your favorite Japanese food? Urr <.> probably I like sushi. Mhm. Yeah. I like sushi a lot. Like raw fish and I really I like it a lot. It's one of my favorites. Mm. Ur is there is sushi in XXX04 different from Japanese real ones? Yeah. Actually urm they have sushi in XXX04 that they don't have in Japan which is really weird. laughter Like XXX10 is not it's like a American Japanese food. And urm ur what else? Oh in United States, when they have the the sushi that goes around, they put it on little boats and they float in the water, and it goes around. Yeah. I didn't I thought I mean I thought it came from Japan, right? But when I asked my host sister, she said they don't have that here because here's only on the conveyor belt. Right. And it goes around. And I was like, ""What? They don't have it here?"" And she's like, ""No, I've never heard of that before."" laughter So I was really surprised. Yeah. They have but they put on boats and it's in like a little thing in water and they float around. It's really cute. But Yeah. yeah, I didn't know that they don't have it in Japan. Wow. laughter Yeah, it's weird. It's really weird. It's fancy. Yeah. Yeah. Hm. I know. And there's one other thing urm I was asking mm one of my Japanese friends if she's ever had mirugai before. And she said she's never heard of it. I don't know if you've heard of it before. It's like I was really surprised because it's pretty expensive sushi in the United States. They have it in the restaurant. And it's ? I don't really . It's like a big clam kind of thing. Mhm. Ur it's like a big clam, and then you eat it raw. So it's like a piece of that on top of rice. Hm. And it's really good. Because I was telling her it's really good. It's kind of crunchy. It's really good and I like it a lot. But it's really expensive. And she's never heard of it lebo before. So I wasn't sure if maybe it was just they ha only have it there or something. Mhm. But. laughter I've never heard of it either. Yeah. laughter That's so strange. I don't know why. I don't maybe I don't know. Wow. Yeah. Interesting. O K. laughter laughter All right. So we have come to almost the end Oh. of the interview. Uh-huh. So are you going to have any classes this afternoon? No. I'm done Uh. done. So you can go home? Yeah. Hmm. I'll just do some homework though, so probably stay. But yeah. Mhm. So what time er does your host mother usually come home? She she works everyday ur not everyday, but like she works like a full-time job. Hm. So she comes home around six or six-thirty Hm. everyday. After that, you have dinner? Mm-hm. We have dinner around seven. Mhm. Hm. All three of you together? Mm-hm. Yeah. Usually sometimes my host sister might go out with her friends Hm. or something. But yeah, usually I go home for dinner. We have dinner together. Mhm. Mm-hm. It's very nice. So what kind of things do you usually talk about with them? Mhm during dinner or just the? Mhm. Yeah, during dinner. Oh urm like what I did today, urm whether I have homework or not. laughter Urm usually they keep the T V on all the time so like all the time. I don yeah, my like at home in America, my mom hates it when we watch T V while we eat. Mh-hmm. So that's kind of different because at home, I never watch T V while I eat. But here, the T V is always on while we are eating. laughter So even if we don't have something to talk about, we watch T V or we talk about what's going on on T V. Oh. So yeah. Mhm. O K. All right. laughter Thank you very much coming. This is the end of the interview. laughter Oh you're welcome, thank you. Thank you.",0

It's so much different from the Midwest in the United States that I really enjoy it. Because usually I'm around ur small-town people, I guess. And so big city is really different. And I really kind of enjoy that. Mhm. Because it's a change of pace. Yeah. What do you enjoy most? The people, definitely. Ur awesome people. All my Japanese friends. I mean it's it's not like it was easier to make friends. But when I got here, it was like that was prob that is probably a most amazing part. It's just how cool they are, and and how um understanding they are to me ur learning Japanese, laughter Mm-hm. learning the language and or helping me. And it also helps that they know more English than I know Japanese. So. I see. Yeah. So what about those Japanese friends are cool? Ur laughter what about them is cool? Mhm. Ur they're ur they just are uh I don't know, cool is relative so I just think they're I think they're really nice. I think they're a lot fun to be around. And fun is different here because it seems so restrained. Hm. But they like to have fun. And especially the drinking aspect. Like because where I come from, it's Hm. it's more of a taboo. If you drink, it's like, ""Oh that person drinks."". So but here, it's just like, ""Oh yeah, let's go out and grab a drink or something."". laughter So it's a lot different. I see. O K. So what kind of places do you usually go for drinking? Oh goodness. Urm to a to a bar sometimes. But usually it's at when we go out to dinner, Hm. we have a couple of drinks at dinner. Or it's on Friday or Saturday night, we go to ur nomihoudai, Mm mm. is that what's it called? And I yeah, all-you-can-drink for a few hours and then get a little bit tipsy, and laughter and do a lot more talking. So. I see. O K. But it's a lot of fun because they like to have fun. Mhm. All right. So where are you from? You said you're. XXX02, XXX03. It's around XXX04, XXX03, Mhm. United States. Could you tell me more about your hometown? I sure can. Ur located right next to a big city or bigger city, XXX04, my hometown is XXX02, XXX03. And ur I was born there. I've lived relatively all my life there. And it's very religious-oriented. We ha the church I belong to is affiliated in XXX02, and that basically it's starting there, and has a large following there. Ur makes it sound like a cold cabinet. But it's just ur let's see. It's a city with two high schools. Mhm for for American standards, I guess that's kind of ur it's a little bit bigger than small where laughter Hm. base of that average. So ur small town. There's things to do on Friday nights. There's <.> places to hang out. I can go bowling. It's kin it's almost country, but it's not country. laughter It's too north to be country-country, like Texas or something like that. Ohh. So it's it's a nice town. It's quaint. Mhm. Oh except, oh Gees, we're not really proud of this. But a few years back, we were the meth capital of the United States. Methamphetamines, like there's a lot of meth labs in people's basements. And there was a lot of drug busts in my city. Oh really. So Hmm. safe, not always, but Hm. laughter but a nice place to live. Mhm. There's a good part of town and bad part of town. I see. And the name, XXX02 Mm-hm. is a bit strange to me. Ur do you do you know what the meaning is? Yeah. XXX02. O K. Urm is named after XXX05, one of the American presidents. Mm-hm. Ur it is named a as a matter of fact, the county that I live in is XXX06 County named after XXX05. Mh-hmm. And the ci and the city XXX02, was named after one of his evidently one of XXX05 's greatest quality was his independence or his strife for independence. So that's how we got our name. Oh I see. O K. All right. And in Japan, where do you live? XXX07. XXX07. How long yeah, In XXX08 Prefecture. how how long does it take to go to XXX08 from here? Ur with the walk with the walk and the train, it's only about fifty minutes. Hm. Almost an hour. Mm-hm. So it's pretty sh it's relatively short compared to everyone else's. Mhm. Ur everyone els or either XXX09 students have to travel. Mm-hm. So do you live there with your host family? Yes, I do. Mm. My host family my dad is a dentist. My mom is a housewife. And they have three kids. And so with me, it's six. But it's good thing that they have a big house because otherwise they wouldn't have anywhere to put me. Mhm. Two two girls and a boy are the kids. Mm. So. Do you sometimes do something with those kids? Oh yeah. Sometimes we play outside. It's been getting cold lately so Hm. we haven't had a chance to do that. Mh-hmm. And the boy, he's not very athletic so he doesn't he likes to play video games and stuff. So sometimes we play video games. Urm but one of the girls is really adventurous so she likes to go outside and hit the tennis ball around. So Mhm. we do that sometimes. Wow. And throw Chinese plastic Chinese stars at each other. laughter laughter But that's ninja ninja stars. All right. O K. So first thing today, please look at this picture. And please describe this picture. Describe this picture. Well the sun is very happy. laughter And there is a car parked in front of a house. Urm this house looks to be about one story except for maybe an attic. Hm. Urm there's a large window in the front, and a girl jumping rope in front of that big window. cough Ur I see a bunch of dogs. There's about three dogs in the picture. I like cats myself. Urm oh there is a cat. There is a cat on top of the car. It's parked right out front of the house. And there seems to be a lot of uh foliage, meaning bushes and trees and stuff. And it seems to be a pretty nice day. Probably a spring day or an early fall day because these people wearing dresses. Er gentleman jogging, and boys wearing shorts playing volleyball in the side yard of the house. Across the street, there is a man reading a paper on a bench. And there seems to be out front of another house. And urm there is a street that crosses the picture diagonally. And down the street, there is part of another house. And urm looks to be maybe about an inter an intersection because this looks like it takes a corner there. Mm. O K. All right. And you mentioned you like cats I do like cats. better than dogs. Better than dogs. Just something I don't like dogs for sometimes dogs can smell. They're kind of gross. laughter Cats I used to have two cats. Uh-huh. Squeak and Flash. And named after their characteristics. One of them would meow really high so we called him Squeak. laughter And Flash because he's very high te high tension. ""Pshhh"". very fast. Uh-huh. He chased me around the house. And Mhm. but cats can snuggle, dogs can lick. Uh-huh. That's about it. laughter I I just love cats. I see. So why did you decide to keep those two cats? Well Hm. urm that's es especially a good question. Because they were very they got to be very sick, and we waited a long time before we ur had it checked out and they had cancer of like the inside. And so eventually I had to put them down. But ur we kept in this because we loved them me and my brother really liked them. But because we've grown up like we had them for, I guess, their whole life, almost, ur eight years or so. Growing up through elementary school and middle school and high school. So we grew attached to them and Hm. knew them. And they knew us and played with them. Mhm. So it was fun. How did you play with the cats? How did I play with my cats? Yeah. Well. Flash, I would chase around the house. Hm. laughter And when Flash was laying down, Flash always laid on like side ways. His arms would be over here and his would be on the other side. So I alway if you scratch right by his tail, he would just curl up laughter and then start rolling around back and forth, trying to bite my hand. Hm. And so that's how I played with Flash sometimes. And Squeak, Squeak just like to sleep and eat. Mm. laughter I can't exactly eat with Squeak. Mm-hm. I just slept with Squeak. So when I watch T V or something, he woul would come sit on my chest or something. Mhm. Well sounds nice. laughter O K. All right. Next picture. Next picture. O K. Please describe this. This picture has an open door. It looks like possibly a dorm room or someone's just room in general. cough Urm clock on the wall says looks like it says about eight about eight o'clock. And there's a computer in front of a lady. And the lady is next to a dog. And there's a cat all right, cats. Ur a bed in the room. There when you walk in the door to the right is a stereo system, and the stereo system is on top of a bookshelf. In the boo there's two levels to this bookshelf. On the top level is a phone and some books to the left side. And on the bottom, there are books. There's about ten books to the right. And some space and then it looks like a couple of books next to that. Above the stereo that's on the top of this book case, i or above that is a calendar on the wall. And it's marked June. Doesn't say a year. But then you walk your way around, and there's a clock on the wall urm a different wall. And on that same wall, there's a window with curtains. And in front of that window is a desk. And on top of the desk is a computer. Ur the computer has a keyboard. Urm it has a a monitor and it has a regular part of the computer. And right next to that, there is a word-processing machine, looks to type papers or something. And there is only a paper and a mouse other than those things but some paper and a mouse other than the computer and a word-processor on top of the desk. Ur in front of the desk to the other side of the window ur on opposite side as the window, there is a lady sitting in the chair. This lady's wearing a skirt and a sweater. And she eu has a hand out towards the computer. And she seems to be looking ur the other direction in towards the room. Ur don't really know why. Maybe she's looking at her dog. But her dog's on the ground. She seems to be staring at her cat. But the cat's just sleeping on the bed. laughter And next to the chair that the lady sitting in, there is a trash can. And besides the light switch and a plug, it seems to be all there is in the room. Mm. O K. Ur do you have your own room in XXX07? Yes, I do. Mhm. As a matter of fact, I was surprised how big it was. I also have my own lap-top computer in there. Wow. And own little desk and zabuton. And a futon next to that. Mm. So do you sleep in futon? Yeah. Yeah. Sleep on. How do you like it? I love it. I used to have a futon in the United States. Mh-hmm. There was my mom's old bed. And when I was little there, I would go in sleep on it with her in the middle of the night. And she just gave it to me eventually. I was ur I could sleep on that thing for hours, that will do. So it's no different than that. It's nice. Mhm. O K. And you use lap-top computer? Oh yes. Seems to work out very good for me. Hm. Do a lot of e-mailing. So I don't have to stay at school and do all that e-mailing. Hm hm. I can just go home. And and my parent ur my dad evidently makes quite a bit of money as dentist. Because he has a lot of toys Hm. in his house, Mh-hmm. and part of that is the wireless internet. So there's no cords. Just sticks in a little card inside of the in the lap-top. And it connects to the internet where the port is upstairs, I think. But Hmm. so I can roam free about the house if I wanted to with that thing. cough laughter O K. But I believe the computer is in Japanese system. Ah it's mostly Japanese. Yeah. It's a it's a Windows system. So it's easy to operate. And I've operated one before. So. Mhm. And the keyboard is similar. It's a Japanese system. Mm mm mm mm mm. But pretty easy. Mhm. No problem? Yeah. Not too much. My room is a mess, though. laughter I mean it really is a mess. Uh-huh. It's a good thing I have it all for myself otherwise, it could be baddies. Mhm. O K. So what does your mother say? Urm I do have a lot of privacy really. I can and they don't really say anything about it. And sometimes I tell them, ""Oh I gotta go clean my room now."". They're like, ""Ohh O K."". laughter But I have er brought a sweeper in there, you know, I probably should do that. But just things I things that I that are not really dirty, my clothes and stuff, Hm. I stick it on one arm on side. And then some little luggage pieces, I just keep it one side all the time. I have books lying out and stuff I need for classes everyday. Next to the computer, urm kind of a desk thing is ur I have tapes because I take I do a tape journal or recording journal. Because it's a lot easier than writing. Mhm. And some C Ds and stuff just room shall we say around the room. Mhm. I see. O K. All right. So cough we'll try a role-play. O K. Please read this card.

Mm-hm. Urm if I was to do that in the United States, I probably I might do it on the line, actually. Hm. Or ask my parents if they knew a travel agent that I can talk to. Hmm. And then when I go to the travel agent, ask them, say, ""I wanna go to Hawaii,"" Hm. or ""I want to go to Texas for a week, Mm mm mm. and stay next to the ocean."". Hmm. And they would say, ""Oh here are some things you can do. How long do you wanna stay?"". They'll probably ask me q eh questions like that. I would say, ""I'd like to stay a week,"" or ""I'd like to Hm. maybe see the Alamo, travel to San Antonio,"" or something. Mm. ""Well there's a tour going up there the same week that you're there, and da-da-da-da,"" Hm. I'd say ""O K."".

So during the summer me and my brother, we drive twelve hours down to XXX10. And it's very tiring, but it's a lot of fun just because in one summer, we took our friends down there, too, when we had two cars. So it was fun. We had walkie-talkies between the cars. laughter And so it was fun just to talk back and forth and mess around. Mm-hm. Speed up, slow down, speed up, slow down. Just kind of hang out.

Just because this is Japan, and Mm-hm. and ur I like to see the sights and see what they have in stores. They have a lot of different stuff than I have in XXX12. Maybe it's just a XXX12. Because maybe ur places like L. A. or New York would have some of the stuff. Hmm. But I'm not used to seeing. It's not only Japanese stuff. I went urr Harajuku maybe. Mm-hm. And they had and we went to this not authentic Japanese, but it was mm they have like bowls and dishes and chopsticks and all these different kind of stuff. That was really kind of interesting, and I thought about getting some pottery or something for my mom. Hm. There is these little plastic sumo wrestlers that had their legs lifted. I thought I might get one of those for my brother. laughter So it's it's fun shopping now. Maybe it's a stuff I've never seen before. Hmm. Just new experiences. It's amazing. Mhm. My sensory perception here in Japan. So do you do a lot of shopping in XXX07, too? XXX07. Hm. Urm cough But ur only shopping, sort of. Shopping as a looking around, yes. Shopping as a buying things, not really. Mhm. There's not really a lot to shop. Hm. There're not a lot of shops to do like that. But on my way home, there is a Saty. Hm. And so sometimes I go in there and grab some bananas. And I go upstairs and maybe look at some clothes. But I don't really do a lot in XXX07. Not many shops? Plus. Yeah. Not really that many. O K. Last one. The interviewee is reading the card. O K. O K. Ur may I help you, sir? Ur yes. I'm going to buy ur a train ticket for the train to New York that leaves at three o'clock. O K. There're two kinds of trains which leave at two o'clock. One is express and the other is local. Which would you like? Ur I'm guessing the local is cheaper, is that correct? Mm-hm. O K. I'm not in that big of a hurry so I'll take that one. Uh O K. But I'll take the local. i it takes five hours. Five hours? Uh-huh. And the trains are not very nice. laughter How long does the express take? Ur two hours and a half. Two and a half hours. Yeah. And the cars are really ur gorgeous and rich.

Wow. laughter And the only the only reason, it's like which is like a really random place for it to be. But that's where my field placement is on Wednesdays. Ahh. And ur it's a small st it's a really small station. You get there though subway. Mm-hm. It takes me two hours to get there from XXX07 which is on the other side of Tokyo. Right. But it's it's really calm. And like as soon as you walk out of the station, there's not really much bustle. Hm. There is uh you just take a left, you go down this quiet street. There is a few cars, yet, it's close like everything in Tokyo. But it's still really nice and Hm. it's it's a nice quiet walk to work. And you see neighborhood people cleaning their door steps. Hm. You walk passed, I guess it's the train station maintenance place where they people transfer that the crews transfer from trains and stuff. Hm. So it's just a nice quiet walk to work. And I work in an apart in someone's apartment literally. And so and it is a really quiet place and so just makes me feel kind of calm and relax when I go there. Mhm. So. Hm. So what do you do in that someone's apartment presently? I work for work for and then intern for and a field placement at ur XXX14 Japan. Have you e Habitat for Humanity is a volunteer organization. Hmm. Like me, I guess I can give you their little ur mission statement. It's cough XXX14 now is a world-wide organization dedicated to eliminating poverty housing Hm. and homelessness from the face of the earth by basically buildings building houses for people. People go on global village trips to different areas around in around the world, I guess. There's even some places in the United States. And you build houses for people who can't really afford it. Wow. Yeah. You dedicate your own money and your own time for usually about a week and a half or two weeks to building a house. I've never really heard that organization. Really? Mhm. Eh it's a very small I visit it's the two ladies' apartment that I work for. And they work in their apartment. Mh-hmm. And they're really cool, really nice people. And I did it in the United States.

Wow that can be joke. Two people walk into a zoo. And they never met each other before in their lives. And one of them walked in with finger up, and one of them walked in with finger down. And that that they were gonna go see the tigers first. They don they didn't know each other. They just met. And they looked at the tiger and the tiger was peeking out at them through the bars. And the gi the girl, we call her Felis, and we'll call him Vincent. And Felis was kind of scared of the tiger. Vincent said, ""There is no need to worry,"" and he gave her such feel about how tigers roam in African jungle. Some B S about that. She was really excited, and really taken by that. She kind of got to liking Vincent. They move down from tiger cage to the zebras. But there was no zebras in the zebra cage. So then went on to the monkeys. But before they went to the monkeys, they stop by an ice-cream shop. And Vincent bought, that was some ice-cream some vanilla ice-cream, her favorite. Urm Felis had just come from school so she was ur she was weighed down heavily by her backpack. And so she asked Vincent to carry it. But Vincent said, ""No, my pockets are full of change so I'm weighed down as well."". So they stared at the monkey for a while. And as Felis ate her ice-cream, the monkey eat his banana right in front of her. And they were so surprised because it was like the monkey had human characteristics. And so after visiting the ur tiger cage and the ur bird cages and a reptile sanctuary, they decided that it was time to go. And they Feli and Vincent went east and Felis went west. And they dec they exchanged phone numbers and decided to ur go out to a bar on Friday night. O K. So why why did you name them Felis and Vincent? Ur I love making er brand new names. laughter Like normally I would just say he and she. Mm-hm. But it's a lot easier when you can label them. Mhm. He, she, he what, she what. It's just that it's too impersonal. Mhm. It's my story. They were my people. O K. And why Vincent particularly? Vincent. My grandfather's first name is Vincent. Oh. And Felis, no reason at all, but it's a funny name. Oh O K. All right. So I think you are an animal lovers. But have you been to a zoo in Japan? Ah er not in Japan. Mm.

O K. Thank you very much for coming. This is the end. You are welcome.",0
"The Decline of the Northeastern Ohio Steel Market: Why Did Attempts by Union Leaders and Concerned Citizens to Revive the Steel Industry Ultimately Fail? An Extended Essay in History By Philosophy E. Walker Candidate Number: xxxxxxxxx Supervisor: Alexis Mamaux Date: January 12, 2004 Word Count: 3215 United World College of the American West Montezuma, NM 87731 USA September 19, 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget. On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close. Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster. Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills. The events that would follow this date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope. Rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open. Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even the takeover of a steel company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had. These well-intentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind. But why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail? When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry. Most importantly, the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem. Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level. A Brief History of Steel in Northeastern Ohio In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as Poland Township. Their blast furnace, “Hopewell,” was the very first blast furnace in the area. During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products. Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago. In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.” During the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast (Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky. By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period. The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills. This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard. Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union, the industry barely survived the Depression years. Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth. Youngstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the post-war period, but the seeds for its downfall were slowly being sown. Strikes racked the town during the forties, fifties, and sixties, and they were often long and bloody. In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed. This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down. At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie. Most importantly, Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive. Old technology was not replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help modernize. It was a recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the faces of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families. Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin. Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide. Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement. However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.” The closings meant the end of Youngstown’s only real industry, the end of its population growth, and then end of economic progress. Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country. Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets. Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably. It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape. The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways. Attempts to Save the Mills The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,” says Ed Mann, a local union leader and organizer. The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington. However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry. The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members. The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure. Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works. The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively. Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government. Here, too, they were ignored. The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed. Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown. They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over. The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill. Immediately after the workers left the building, US steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill. All these efforts eventually came to nothing, and Youngstown’s steel mills remained closed. These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export. The Decline of the World Market The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up. During World War II the rest of the world was hungry for America’s iron and steel products; however, by the seventies no foreign nations needed to import steel in such large quantities. In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports. Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel. Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often. This meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a more competitive product. Foreign steel was also much cheaper. Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive. Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor. Jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries, and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers to pay much less for work. Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities. On a worldwide scale, newer materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad. Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies. However, to American companies already suffering financial setbacks, outdated machinery, and fierce competition, this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford. America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy. Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one, the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were not unique. Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry, but it was not alone. The problem was a national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone. J. Philip Richley, a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills, has summed it up thus: “You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.” The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the entire steel community in America. Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry. The Save Our Valley Campaign: Lack of Funds and Plans Eventually, some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign. As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region. Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people. But the Campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding. The people of Youngstown, being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive. College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations. People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds. The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively. Without funds, the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy. The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component: an actual concrete plan. No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems. Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the situation. People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general. Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down. Without a real plan, nothing could truly be achieved. Without funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good. In effect, it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything. People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did. The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was plunged into economic chaos. The Apathy of USWA United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit. Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs. However, it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not. The higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening. Actually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do. No one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before, and none of the leaders of USWA, not even president Lynn Williams, knew what could be done. It was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in US history, and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered. Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had. Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism. Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism. If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism. This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do. Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone. Regionalism From its very first days the Mahoning Valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets. Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself. Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown, Canfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown (see Figure 3). People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town. However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food. For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread. Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist. Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools. Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side. Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns, and the streets are clean and well kept. With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close proximity to one another, a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area: regionalism. Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations. Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others. With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures. Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing. A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together. In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate. In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride. Conclusion: The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people. The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies. What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level, and perhaps it is not. But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures. Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of people were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities. Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines, or even began living on the streets. For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event- it was the most important event in their lives. The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on. Even though they eventually failed, the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children.",0

Um, I didn't really have a favorite. No? Any particular types, like ones with pictures or . Can you think of a story that they told you that you liked for them to read over and over?

Uh-huh, all the time. Yeah. So, you would check books out? Uh-huh. Mostly, I liked to spend time reading encyclopedias-- Oh, really? --when I was little. You like to read encyclopedias. In your family, do you remember if there was any storyteller? Well, my uncle was always telling stories and, uh, we had this house across the street from where I grew up that was old and he ever finished it. He started it and he told stories that, um, um, men being in it that house at night and stuff and for us not to go outside at night. Would he scare you? Yeah. So we, at a certain time, we were scared to go over there because we'd always go outside and look at the house across the street. Um, did he tell stories to big groups of people, or just one-on-one?

"Hi my name is Sandra Reid and I am part of a family of seven children, um, and my mom and dad have passed away. During our young years we were very poor. We did not have very much but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained, and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories, reading poems, and singing to us. One of the stories that I would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind, I guess, mostly, mainly because it was scary. Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were OK. Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all, as far as working around the house. All of my sisters learned to cook by the age of eight. I learned after I got married so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking. So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes. Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg. Just anything to get out of doing my job. So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family. So she began to tell this story. Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family. And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table. And her little girl just complained, ""I don't want to wash the dishes. I don't want to. My leg hurts, my head hurts. I don't feel good."" The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, ""How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?"" So she said, ""Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."" So the little girl just said, ""OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."" And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time. All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the air. And before you know it, the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head off. And when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying ""Daddy, Daddy! Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife."" Now that knife, when I went to sleep it really scared me. But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that I was OK. Now after that, my mother continued to tell us many, many scary stories and tell us many, many, many poems. I'd like to tell you about how I got into becoming a teacher's assistant. All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school. That was my dream, to teach school. As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this. Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, ""Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."" So she said, ""Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you."" So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, ""Baby, I really want you to go to college. It's always been my dream that my children all go to school. But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."" At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom. I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us. So I never got a chance to go to school. Did anybody? Yes, my brother went to school. He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too. So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte. I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there. I, in later years, I went on to college some but I didn't complete the, uh, whole four years. Um, I remember once, when I was working in a mill, and I was spinning yarn, and I was saying to myself, and, I was praying actually, and I said, ""God, one day I want to work in the school system. If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy."" As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, ""Have you considered being a teacher assistant?"" I said, ""I would love to."" So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont. I'd never gone to college before. I was really afraid. But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there. After a while, the principal said, ""I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like."" Luckily I had all A's. I did very well. And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year. Um, my dream, my prayers were answered. I enjoy my job very much. I can't think of any job that would make me any happier. A few years later, um, I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education. At first I didn't want to apply for it, but the principal called me during the summer months and said, ""Sandra the time is running out, you need to apply."" And he told me I would have to write this paper. Well I didn't like writing at the time but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper. And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper. And I went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh I won't get the scholarship. Who cares? I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy. But one day I came in and I looked at my mail and I was accepted. I couldn't believe it. Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself. So I went on and took the courses, and as I started I think I was taking economics. I think that was the last class I took. My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school. But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued? Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom. I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence. And they hired a sub but the sub didn't do that much. I had to take over the classroom. So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband. After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school. I just got to a certain age and I said, ""No I can't do this anymore,"" so I never went back. But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so. How many different schools did you teach at? I've only worked at two, two schools. The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down. So I was in those situations where I first, come first, transfer last, come first to transfer out. So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill. I didn't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really, really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park. But then, after awhile, I fell in love with Berryhill. If I'm not mistaken I think I've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years, 17, 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire. And why did the other school close down? Um, the, you know, I really don't know. Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years. I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was. And I enjoy what I do. That's it. All right thank you. Thank you.",0
"My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother. Um, a little background first. Her, let's see, her mother's family were wealthy people at one time. They owned car dealerships and extensive land. Um, I don't know if they were farmers or not, but I know they were land owners, um, many acres and, um, her grandmother was raised in wealth. Uh, then the Depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money. Um, she was raised in MO, and she married a man, this is my grandmother I'm talking about. And they were very poor by this point, and they had, I think, seven children. And one particular Christmas, things were very, very difficult. There was no money to buy any presents at all, um, for the children, and my grandfather, who was killed when my mother was 16, this was, of course, way before that, um, he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he, he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves. Um, I felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love. And although I never met my grandfather, I have never forgotten that story and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful, wonderful person he must have been. And how long have you lived in Charlotte? Oh, I have lived in Charlotte, um, for a year. Um, I lived in Charlotte for five years. We came here in 1986, we lived here for five years, then we moved to Raleigh for seven years and now we've been back one year. Well, good.",0
"Red Pants While writers whose business it is to be witty often fail to produce, grave authors occasionally are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their minds. From a lifetime of undisciplined reading with innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind, I have gleaned a harvest of what I am pleased to denominate Red Pants items, a sampling of which follows. My designation derives from a splash of vivid writing in Francis Thompson's A Corymbus for Autumn in which he proclaims how “day's dying dragon” was Panting red pants into the West. In this trousers category, Thompson must share the limelight with Coleridge by virtue of the line in Kubla Khan : As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing. Even Shelley may stake a claim, if only in the pajama division of this sector, thanks to his description in Epipsychidion of how ... the slow, silent night Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep. Since everthing is to be found in Shakespeare, it is not surprising that on at least two occasions the Board has contributed his own Red Pants nuggets. In Antony and Cleopatra (Act IV, Scene VIII, lines 14 et seq .) Antony commands the wounded Scarus to ... leap thou, attire and all, Through proof of harness to my heart, and there Ride on the pants triumphing. And in Othello (Act II, Scene I, line 80) Cassio utters the fervent prayer that Othello might Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms. A variation on this theme occurs in Alba de Céspedes' The Secret (translated from the Italian by Isabel Quigly: Simon and Schuster, New York, 1958, page 114) where she confides that “I still had a whole afternoon before me to spend, and I used it to tidy up my drawers....” One may well wonder what Miss Stowe had in mind when, in Uncle Tom's Cabin (Chapter 5), she narrates how “Mrs. Shelby stood like one stricken. Finally, turning to her toilet, she rested her face in her hands, and gave a sort of groan.” In this same vein, the mirthless Milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of nations when, in describing Mount Etna in Book I of Paradise Lost (lines 236-7) he penned And leave a singed bottom all involved With stench and smoke: ... And in Chapter VI of Vanity Fair , when Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, sought to console Amelia for Joe Sedley's jilting of her dear Rebecca, Thackeray confides (indelicately?) that Amelia wept confidentially on the housekeeper's shoulder “and relieved herself a good deal.” Chuckles often emanate from the British employment of a term in a sense at variance with American usage. There is that oft-quoted example, near the opening of Trial by Jury , where Defendant asks, “Is this the Court of the Exchequer?” and having been assured that it was, Defendant (aside) commands himself to “Be firm, be firm, my pecker.” The British, of course, do not giggle at this bit of Gilbertian dialogue, since to them pecker means `courage,' as in the phrase “to keep your pecker up.” Two of the more common examples of British-American divergence of usage are screw and knock up . In Vanity Fair (Chapter 39), the niggardly Sir Pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat your American sophomore might fancy him to be when he “screwed his tenants by letter.” He was simply making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees. Similarly, when in Chapter XXXIV of the same novel, Mrs. Bute reminds her husband that “You'd have been screwed in goal, Bute, if I had not kept your money,” she was not speaking of pleasures deferred. In Bleak House (Chapter XXVII) Grandfather Smallweed, referring to Mr. George, warns Mr. Tulkinghorn that “I have him periodically in a vice. I'll twist him, sir. I'll screw him, sir.” In Kipling's The Light That Failed (Chapter XIII), Torpenhow urges Dick to attend a party that night, “We shall be half screwed before the morning,” is his dismal sales pitch to Dick. In Chapter VI of Vanity Fair , Thackeray reports on Joe Sedley's drunken avowal to wed Becky Sharp the next morning, even if he had to “knock up the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth,” in order to have him in readiness to perform the ceremony. In Great Expectations (Chapter VI), we learn how “... Mr. Whopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper.” And who could blame him? Many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from the pure-minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable parts of the human body. It does not take a too-wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a lewd nature. Who can, for instance, blame a youth with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing when he reads in Pater's Marius The Epicurean (Chapter V) a reference to Apuleius' The Golden Ass noting that “all through the book, there is an unmistakably real feeling for asses ...”? In Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter VII), one reads about a boy “cudgelling an ass,” and one goes back over the passage to reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical error for “cuddling.” One may be indulged a giggle even though he is sure that Isak Dinesen did not intend an impropriety when she recorded in Out of Africa (Part V, Chapter 4) how “Fathima's big white cock came strutting up before me.” And one is certain that Kenneth Rexroth, in his American Poetry in the Twentieth Century (Herder and Herder, N.Y., 1971) did not intend to hint at closet biographical matter when, in Chapter I, he wrote that “Whitman's poems are full of men doing things together,” or, later in the same chapter, when he referred to “Whitman's joyous workmen swinging their tools in the open air.” College freshman still read with flendish glee the first line in Canto I of Spenser's The Faerie Queene (and never mind the title!) that tells how A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine. In his poem Mr Nixon (from Hugh Selwyn Mauberley ), Ezra Pound's Mr. Nixon advises kindly Don't kick against the pricks, although the identities of the latter are not divulged. One is entitled to speculate on what outrageous proposal the narrator had made in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, Vol. 2—Cities of the Plain (translated by C. K. Scott Moncrieff—Modern Library, N.Y., 1934, Page 90) to cause the Duchess to say, “Apart from your balls, can't I be of any use to you?” There is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to his friend, Edward Marsh, from somewhere near Fiji (p. 463 of A Treasury of the World's Great Letters , Simon and Schuster, N.Y., 1940) in which he relates how he sends his native boy up a palm tree, where he “cuts off a couple of vast nuts ...” (macho victim not disclosed). In the first chapter of Uncle Tom's Cabin , Miss Stowe offers a dialogue between Haley and Mr. Shelby, part of which goes, “ `Well,' said Haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season, `what do you say?' ” In Bleak House (Chapter XXIV) Dickens may cause some readers to blush when he wrote of Mr. George's blush that “He reddened a little through his brown.” We must move ineluctably to a consideration of perfectly reputable words which, having acquired sexual connotations, cause adolescent—and often adult— hilarity, even when read by a person of only mildly prurient mind. In Forster's A Passage to India (Chapter XXXI) a vivid picture is created by the sentence “Tangles like this still interrupted their intercourse.” Pages later (Chapter XXXVII), it is acknowledged that “He, too, felt that this was their last free intercourse.” Apparently from then on, it was going to have to be cash or credit card only. In The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter V), we are informed that the heroine “placed certain restrictions on their intercourse,” a limitation that might have been more usefully set in that same author's Rob Roy (Chapter VII) where we are told of the chance that the narrator and Miss Vernon might be “thrown into very close and frequent intercourse.” A variation of this theme is found in Robert Browning's The Flight of the Duchess (Section V): —Not he! For in Paris they told the elf Our rough North land was the Land of Lays, even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is número uno in this area of human activity. More picturesque are the references to erections. An arresting one occurs in A Passage to India (Chapter XXI) in which Forster describes a small building as “a flimsy and frivolous erection,” while in The Mayor of Casterbridge (Chapter XVI) the Mayor himself “beheld the unattractive exterior of Farfrae's erection.” A phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader. Consider Dickens' sharp image in Bleak House (Chapter LIV) when he describes how “Sir Leicester leans back in his chair, and breathlessly ejaculates.... ” Or, in Nicholas Nickleby (Chapter XLVII), where that admirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur Gride “again raised his hands, again chuckled, and again ejaculated.” And in his short tale, Lionizing , Edgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction of one of his characters: “ ` Admirable! ' he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre.” Alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative meanings over the years! Earlier in this century, pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete male, thereby cheapening forever lines like Shelley's noble image in Adonais (verse XXXIII): His head was bound with pansies over-blown, not to mention Poe's odd allusion in For Annie : With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies. Or, more slap-stickish, E.F. Benson's action picture in Lucia in London (Chapter 8): “Georgie stepped on a beautiful pansy.” Of more recent vintage is gay . Nobody used to snicker at Chaucer's line (No. 5818) in The Prologe of the Wyf of Bathe , in which that harried dame asks: Why is my neghebores wif so gay? In his poem The Menagerie , one of William Vaughan Moody's characters advises: If nature made you so graceful, don't get gay, while in Othello (ah, the Bard again!) in his dialogue with Desdemona and Emilia on the praise of women, Iago refers to the kind that Never lack'd gold, and yet went never gay. (Act II, Scene I, line 150) And what in the world is one to make of William Butler Yeats's startling revelation in his poem Lapis Lazuli (from Last Poems ) that They know that Hamlet and Lear are gay.? Indeed it is an amusing, albeit utterly wasteful pastime to pursue the quest for Red Pants examples. May good cess befall all such quixotically misguided readers! One caveat: never assume blithely that an odd word or suspicious phrase is as lubricious as it sounds. In The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter VI) Bucklaw vows, “I will chop them off with my whinger,” and one feels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is but a whinyard, which is merely a short sword. “Turning a corner of the Mazza Gallerie into a women's tennis store, I was startled to see ... hordes of giggling high school girls ... ” [From an article by Dorothy Gilliam in the Washington Post , . Submitted by .] LIGHT REFRACTIONS If you are a fan of old-fashioned jazz—what is now known as “traditional” or “trad” jazz—you are familiar with one of the standard “jump tunes” of the genre—a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble . Even if you are not a fan, you must have heard it as least a dozen times. It is the one that goes, “Dah! Dah! Dah! Dah! da-dat-dat-dah! Da-de-da-de-da-de-dat-dat-dah ! da-de-da-de-da-de-dat-dat-dah!” That's it; sure; you've heard it. I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble back in about 1940, when I was in my early teens. My memory is rickety, but I am sure my first recording was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE, and I think, though I am less sure, that it was played by the late “Muggsy” Spanier, who was, to my mind, one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters. Later, I got another recording of the same tune, this one by, I think, Mezz Mezzrow. The label said, MUSKAT RAMBLE. I thought that was surely the first time I had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in, of all things, a simple title on a simple 78-rpm record. (This, remember, was in my youth, and it was a time when typographical errors were called typographical errors, not typos—at least by kids in junior high.) Some time later, I got still another version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE, with still another version of the title. This time, it was MUSCAT RAMBLE. That, I thought, was really absurd. Not only had they left out the “R”; they'd changed the “K” to “C”. Now, it made no sense at all. On the other hand, I reasoned, if there were, in fact, some sort of cat called a muscat, perhaps it wasn't so outrageous. I looked up muscat in my Webster's and found that it is a `variety of grape.' To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous. I was young and, by today's standards, at least, pathetically innocent. During my time in senior high, and, after that, in the Army Air Force, I had other things on my mind (there was a war on, after all), and I didn't give the MUSKRAT-MUSKAT-MUSCAT RAMBLE problem any thought. Speaking of my time in the AAF, which was utterly undistinguished, I think I must make a confession. Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour, Indiana. It was winter and bitterly cold. The wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with what seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our bodies. One day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero, I took shelter in the service club. There was the omnipresent phonograph, or Vic , short for Victrola, and the stack of records next to it. In those days, people as a rule did not take much care of phonograph records. Usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks, where they picked up dust, scratched one another, and traded static electricity. I was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records, and I came across three Bessie Smiths. I played all three, and the few other G.I.s in the room, which was quite large—big enough for a fair-sized dance with a small orchestra—either paid no attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn Miller or Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead. Among Bessie's numbers were Dying Gambler's Blues, Sing Sing Prison Blues , and one I had never heard called Black Mountain Blues , which has the imcomparable lines, Home in Black Mountain a chile' will smack yo' face; Home in Black Mountain a chile' will smack yo' face; Babies cry for liquor an' all the birds sing bass. and Goin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor an' my gun; Goin' back to Black Mountain, me an' my razor an my gun; Goin' cut him if he stan' still, goin' shoot him if he run. I was, and still am, captivated by “Babies cry for liquor an' the birds sing bass,” and in the arrogance of my youth, I was certain that nobody else on the airfield either knew or cared who Bessie Smith was, nor would any other G.I. be enchanted by basso birds, so I turned thief. I can't remember how I did it, but somehow I smuggled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough. I kept them in good shape until my last 78-rpm turntable died. End of digression and back to MUSKRAT-KAT-CAT: Muskrat Ramble is credited to Edward “Kid” Ory and Ray Gilbert. “Kid” Ory played great jazz trombone. The only thing I know about Gilbert is that I find him listed as co-author of Muskrat Ramble . About thirty years ago, when I was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand, I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that I thought might be exactly right for my sauce. It wasn't bad, The wine jogged my thoughts back to Muscat Ramble . Muscatel is made from muscat grapes, is sometimes called muscat , and, being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content, is the booze of choice for a great many wines. An old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthday—meaning twenty years of AA sobriety—a couple of years ago, tells me that when he was on the skids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk tank, the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle and Napa Valley smoke . I made up my mind that Muscat Ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune. My reasoning is that it is not likely that “Kid” Ory or Ray Gilbert had ever seen a muskrat, and it's even less likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling. Muskrats, according to my encyclopedia, look like giant rats, are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds, have partially webbed feet, and do a good deal of swimming. They do not appear to do much rambling. Muscat, or muscatel, on the other hand, is found on skid rows all over the land. A guy with a bottle-shaped brown paper bag, damp and wrinkled at its upper end, has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof, and the odds are pretty good you would find it is a muscadoodle . After the guy finishes his Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off, he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix. Now he is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his roadmapped eyes. I suspect that that is precisely the song's origin. My theory is that the “r” got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat . It is the same reason most of us, I assume, have heard, “He's in the hospital with prostrate trouble.” Prostrate is a more common word that prostate , so prostrate is what we get. The “r” fits in naturally. I got a strange sort of corroboration from my good friend Rosy McHargue, who is now pushing eighty-seven years and has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbands—Benny Goodman, Red Nichols, Ted Weems, and a slew of others. Rosy, too, had seen the tune as Muskrat, Muskat , and Muscat . I asked him what he thought the original title was. He had known “Kid” Ory well, and he said, “You know, Tom, I'm not exactly sure. I once asked Ory about it and he said, `It's m-u-s-c-a-t. Muskrat .' So I think that's just the way everyone said muscat .” There you are. I find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually. I picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water, but I wouldn't call that rambling. On the other hand, a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level—now that has a touch of poetry. Maybe not in the same class with “all the birds sing bass,” but poetry, nevertheless. As a nonexpert, although interested, subscriber to VERBATIM, it is “a bit mysterious” to me that the singular noun absence takes the plural verb are . I refer to the first sentence of your article about the Longman Dictionary [XV,1]. Helen W. Power, in “Women on Language; Women in Language,” [XV,2] may bewail the insensitivity of the male. But she betrays her own elitist insensitivity when she describes a flight attendant as “the person who passes peanuts on an airplane.” I hope Ms./Miss/Mrs. Power never needs to draw on the considerable first-aid and emergency training that every attendant must master. Antipodean Newsletter Leonard Bloomfield, having begun with a theory of meaning which emphasized the environment in which objects were present and named, had to add the obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is not present. I have lately been reading accounts of the exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of Australia in the 1870s and I have become very aware of the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency of particular items in discourse. In the desert the missing necessity is water. As the explorer Ernest Giles put it, the explorer's experience is a “baptism worse than that of fire—the baptism of no water.” My impression was that in the journals of desert explorers the word water , alone or in compounds, and words relating to water, were unusually frequent. It is, I suppose, likely that people with little money must think of money more than the well-off do and that the hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty on drink. Here was a chance to quantify such things. I decided to make a count of words relating to water in reports of desert exploration. Taking quite at random a single page (page 7) in the journals of the Gregory brothers recording an early (1846) exploration of country east and north of Perth, I find the word water used fifteen times. Ten pages on (page 17), water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream (twice), well (twice), pool, channel , and the circumlocution “essential element.” Two words, dew and shower , refer in the context to the presence of water; the rest are in contexts indicating its absence. I tried another explorer, Ernest Giles. Taking page 17 again, I was reminded that Giles is rather given to semi-serious poetic diction at times, and we find him referring to the presence of water in the Finke River as “the stream purling over its stony floor” or, quoting some bygone poet, “brightly the brook through the green leaflets, giddy with joyousness, dances along.” Perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration. Two hundred pages further on there is less exuberance in the circumlocution “that fluid so terribly scarce in the region,” and in three other references water is simply water . Giles is not always waxing poetic and may, like other explorers, be useful as a source for the history of Australian and general English. His use of the word tank to refer to a hollowed-out reservoir (“Gibson dug a small tank and the water soon cleared”) antedates the OED , for instance. Since this linguistic-statistical study of an obsession might well prove to be an important contribution to psycholinguistics, I decided to make a larger sample of watery words, choosing the straightforward journals of Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton, who led an expedition across the western interior of Australia in 1873-4. In a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages (151-60 of the published journal) there were twenty-eight occurrences of the word water (eight of them in compounds), no page being without at least one example. In addition, there was a rich collection of words relating to water, not necessarily indicating its presence. “Hoping to find a lake” is included, though of course it doesn't indicate the presence of water. Even words which are usually of more general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like this. Gum-trees or rocks (in areas of sand) appear as signs of possible water. Apart from these words and lake , words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool, springs, drainage hole, clay hole, flood, channel, water-courses, water-hole, rock-hole, drink, drinkable, running water, stream , and native well . The last two items merit comment. Stream is often said not to be used in Australia except in metaphorical ways, normally being replaced by creek . Warburton's use: “sandbanks intercept the stream, which finally splits into narow water-courses and spreads itself over the plains, and so it ends as a creek” suggests a somewhat more complex relation between the two words. British-born explorers did not set out to write Australian English, of course. Gregory uses stream in the way normal in England; Giles consistently refers to gens in the hills of central Australia, though glen is not current (outside place-names) in contemporary Australian English. The other name, native well is, as a later explorer David Carnegie, author of Spinifex and Sand (1898), points out, a misnomer. He believes native wells are essentially rock-holes (depressions in rock) buried in fairly shallow sand, which, when hollowed out by the natives, appear to be wells. This sort of misnomer leads Carnegie to suppose that “to the uninitiated no map is so misleading as that of West Australia where lakes are salt-bogs without surface water, springs seldom run, and native `wells' are merely tiny holes in the rock, yielding from 0 to 200 gallons.” Carnegie also describes namma-holes and soaks as sources of water. Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir. Namma-holes have been variously described; to Carnegie they are depressions on the surface of rocks, often with a rounded bottom, where stones are often found, suggesting that the stones have something to do with the formation of the holes. Some nostalgic early Australians deplored the loss in our speech of English country words, the glens and streams (alive, anyway, in the journals of explorers), coppices and brooks, woods, becks , and rivulets . Perhaps these words did not really fit. We might have done better with Arabic-speaking settlers. Wadi , for instance, would describe an inland creek rather well. Be that as it may, a later Australian visitor to English drizzle might feel nostalgic when thinking of the parched and thirsty but water-obsessed vocabulary developed in the drier areas of our sunburnt land. Favorite Grammatical Game: Puzzling Pronouns Here is a game just made to while away the hours on a commuter train with your favorite author, a perfect place to hunt for Puzzling Pronouns . Fowler lists five instances where a careless writer can go wrong. There is really no excuse, Fowler says (not he says!), but here we give examples of his third case only, where “there should not be two parties justifying even a momentary doubt about which the pronoun represents.” And here the deluge of printed matter abounds with such specimens that one would suppose them to be the rule rather than the exceptions. It is a game that is like fishing in a barrel, but more stimulating mentally. I am not picking on the following authors; it is just a random catch. In Thomas Hardy's The Hand of Ethelberta , it is suggested by Ethelberta that she and some others go to see Milton's tomb in Cripplegate church. Her suitor, Neigh, who had proposed marriage in a previous chapter, appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelberta's suggestion. This apprehension is observed by a Mr. Belmaine and mistaken by him for an indication that Neigh has been dragged into going to the church against his will “by his over-hasty wife.” One wonders whether the marriage had secretly taken place between the consecutive chapters! You see, it is Belmaine's wife who was doing the dragging. Somerset Maugham was a good and careful grammarian but now and then he slipped. In The Letter , a solicitor, Mr. Joyce, is approached by a Mr. Crosbie: He spoke beautiful English, accenting each word with precision, and Mr. Joyce had often wondered at the extent of his vocabulary.... Sometimes I wonder about the extent of my own vocabulary, too, but really, not when I'm interviewing a client. From The Once and Future King , by T. H. White: Naturally it was Lancelot who rescued her. Sir Boss had managed to find him at the abbey, during his two days' absence, and now he came back in the nick of time to fight Sir Mador for the queen. Nobody who knew him would have expected him to do anything else, whether he had been sent away in disgrace or not—but, as it was thought he had left the country, his return did have a dramatic quality. Not to say a quality of confusion—pronoun-cedly so. From Oh What a Paradise it Seems , by John Cheever: The size of Chisholm's teeth, the thickness of his glasses, his stoop and the spring with which he walked all marked him, Sears thought, as a single-minded reformer. His marriage, Sears guessed, would have been unsuccessful and his children would have difficulty finding themselves. No wonder — we've lost them already. Mark Twain poses us a little mystery in Pudd'nhead Wilson: which knife does the killing? Quiet now. Lights, action: I was asleep, but Luigi was awake, and he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed. He slipped the knife out of the sheath and was ready, and unembarrassed by hampering bedclothes, for the weather was hot and we hadn't any. Suddenly that native rose at the bedside, and bent over me with his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at my throat; but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled him downward, and drove his own knife into the man's neck. That is the whole story. Well, was it Luigi's knife or the native's? If we had only that scene to go by we would never really know, and all because of a Puzzling Pronoun —or two! Oh, it can lead one to a rhymed couplet: He loves his brother and his wife, Does he live a double life? Give me my grammatical games any day to a crossword puzzle. The Joys and Oys of Yiddish Rabbi Robert Schenkerman Temple Beth Jacob When Isaac Bashevis Singer was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978, he remarked in his acceptance speech: The high honor bestowed upon me is also a recognition of the Yiddish language—a language of exile, without a land, without frontiers, not supported by any government, a language which possesses no words for weapons, ammunition, military exercises, war tactics. There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude for every day of life, every crumb of success, each encounter of love. In a figurative way, Yiddish is the wise and humble language of us all, the idiom of a frightened and hopeful humanity. The word Yiddish derives from the German judisch `Jewish.' The principal parent of Yiddish is High German, the form of German encountered by Jewish settlers from northern France in the eleventh century. Yiddish is written in the characters of the Hebrew alphabet and from right to left and enjoys borrowing words from Russian, Polish, English, and all the other languages and countries along the routes that Jews have traveled during the past thousand years. Journalist Charles Rappaport once quipped, “I speak ten languages—all of them Yiddish.” Although Yiddish has been in danger of dying out for hundreds of years, the language is spoken today by millions of people throughout the world—Russia, Poland, Rumania, France, England, Israel, Africa, Latin America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States, where, like the bagel, it was leavened on both coasts, in New York and Hollywood. It is spoken even in Transylvania: A beautiful girl awakens in bed to find a vampire at her side. Quickly she holds up a cross. “Zie gernisht helfen,” smiles the vampire. Translation: “It won't do you any good.” Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish (Yinglish) without fully realizing it. Webster's Third New International Dictionary lists about 500 Yiddish words that have become part of our everyday conversations, including: cockamamy (or cockamamie) `mixed-up, ridiculous.' fin slang for `five-dollar bill,' from finf, the Yiddish word for `five.' gun moll a double clipping of gonif's Molly, Yiddish for `thief's girl.' kibitzer `one who comments, often in the form of unwanted advice, during a game, often cards.' mavin `expert.' mazuma `money.' mish-mosh `mess.' schlep to `drag or haul.' schlock `shoddy, cheaply produced merchandise.' schmeer the `entire deal,' the `whole package.' schnoz slang for `nose.' yenta `blabbermouth, gossip; woman of low origins.' ... and so on through the whole megillah : `long, involved story.' A number of poignant Yiddish words defy genuine translation into English: chutzpa `nerve; unmitigated gall;' a quality we admire within ourselves, but never in others. In his delightful study, The Joys of Yiddish (McGraw-Hill 1968), Leo Rosten offers two classic definitions. “Chutzpa is that quality enshrined in a man, who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan. A chutzpanik may be defined as the man who shouts `Help! Help!' while beating you up.” mensch a `real authentic human being—a person.' naches the `glow of pleasure-plus-pride that only a child can give to its parents': “This is my son, the Doctor!” oy not so much a word as an entire vocabulary, as Rosten observes: “can express any emotion, from trivial delight to the blackest woe.” oy vay; oy vay in mir literally, “Oh, pain,” but, in its long or short form, can be used for anything from condolence to lament: On August 6, 1945, the world's first nuclear weapon was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. Two hundred and eighty-two thousand human beings died and tens of thousands more were left burned, maimed, and homeless. [Albert] Einstein, whose letter to Roosevelt had initiated the American effort that resulted in the atom bomb and whose special theory of relativity formed its theoretical basis, heard the news on the radio. For a long time he could only find two Yiddish words traditionally used by Jews in such circumstances: “Oi vey.” —The Little, Brown Book of Anecdotes tsuris the gamut of painful emotions—some real, some imagined, some self-inflicted. Yiddish is especially versatile in describing those poor souls who inhabit the world of the ineffectual, and each is assigned a distinct place in the gallery of pathetic types: schmo, schmendrik, schnook, schmegegge, schlep, schlub, schmuck, putz, klutz, kvetch , and nudnik . Yiddish easily coins new names for new personalities: a nudnik is a `pest'; a phudnik is a `nudnik with a Ph.D.' The rich nuances that suffuse this roll call are seen in the timeless distinction between a schlemiel `clumsy jerk' and a schlimazel `habitual loser': the schlemiel inevitably trips and spills his hot soup—all over the schlimazel. (And the nebbish is the one who has to clean it up.) The Yiddish language, through its color, its target-accurate expressions, its raw idioms, and its sayings exudes a refreshing magic and laughter, mixed with sober thought, that has been handed down from generation to generation and from nation to nation. Yiddish never apologizes for what it is—the earthy, wise soul of an expressive people learning that life is but a mingled yarn, good and ill together. Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom, well-rounded' blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a charity ball. “It happens to be the third most famous diamond in the whole world,” she boasted. “The first is the Hope diamond, then comes the Kohinoor, and then comes this one, which is called the Lipschitz.” “What a stone! How lucky you are!” “Wait, wait,” said the lady. “Nothing in life is all mazel [`good luck']. Unfortunately, with this famous Lipschitz diamond comes also the famous Lipschitz curse.” The other women gasped and asked, “And what is the famous Lipschitz curse?” “Lipschitz,” sighed the lady. The Women's History of the Word Those who are not familiar with feminist writings may find it useful and interesting to consider a book, recently published in Britain, that is typical of the harsher brand of such works. The work in question offers nothing regarding language, so its review here is ancillary to the main function of VERBATIM. The feminist movement is very much alive in Britain, and the “Greenham Common Women” are probably largely responsible for much of the national sentiment against the Cruise missiles installed at an American base near that village. In Britain, as elsewhere, most books by feminist writers are reviewed by women, usually feminists. Men are seldom assigned to review them, possibly because the editor fears that they will be either ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised, if not biased against them, or because the editor is a woman. Because writing an unfavorable review of a (bad) feminist book would be tantamount to treachery, such books are often unjustifiably praised, as was the case with this work by Rosalind Miles, which was well received on its publication in June. According to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book, Rosalind Miles is head of the Centre for Women's Studies at Coventry Polytechnic, a lecturer, broadcaster, journalist, and author of several other books, including a “highly acclaimed” biography of Ben Jonson. One might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship, but the text does not bear out the promise. For the most part, the book consists of a rewriting of history, from the dawn of time, with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes: the “fact” that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization (as the development of agriculture, for instance), often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men; and the “fact” that women have long been subjected to domination by men. Miles suggests that such domination is a recent phenomenon—only a couple of thousand years old—for she points to the clear superiority of women in (primitive) religions and matriarchies, right on through to the Egyptian dynastic rulers. At one point, she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting (in order to keep track of menstruation) and, probably by the same token, astronomy. She quotes (and, presumably, accepts) another source which holds that “woman first awakened in humankind the capacity to recognize abstracts.” If you believe that balderdash, you'll believe anything. In the good old days, we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves. Recent speculation has it that they were not slaves but—what would one call them? — ordinary laborers. Here comes Miles, authoritatively quoting Diodorus, the Greek historian, who recorded (60-30BC) that “innocent women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves whose forced labour built the pyramids: ... bound in fetters, they work continually without being allowed any rest by night or day. They have not a rag to cover their nakedness, and neither the weakness of age nor women's infirmities are any plea to excuse them, but they are driven by blows until they drop dead.” [p.49] As the pyramids were already about 2500 years old when Diodorus wrote his World History , one is given to wonder what his authority might have been for such a vivid description. It is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery to promulgate it. Miles's book is riddled with many similar distortions, convenient omissions, and generalizations: ... Women have always commanded over half the sum total of human intelligence and creativity. From the poet Sappho, who in the sixth century BC was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively and explore the range of female experience, to the Chinese polymath Pan Chao (Ban Zhao), who flourished around AD 100 as historian, poet, astronomer, mathematician and educationalist, the range is startling. In every field, women too numerous to list were involved in developing knowledge and contributing to the welfare of their societies as they did so: the Roman Fabiola established a hospital where she worked both as nurse and doctor, becoming the first known woman surgeon before she died in AD 399. [p.52] Earlier, on page 49, we learnt about Agnodice, “who lived to become the world's first known woman gynaecologist,” in the fourth century BC. Clearly, this rosily checkered past was soon to be replaced, chiefly, it seems, as Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Confucian-Buddhist cultures flourished. It was not too bad early on, when, according to Miles, the seven Maccabean martyrs who “saved Judaism” did so only at the instigation of their mother. Miles continues: In early Christianity likewise, women found not merely a role, but an instrument of resistance to male domination; in choosing to be a bride of Christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male fry. Thousands of young women helped to build the church of God with their body, blood and bones when frenzied fathers, husbands or fiancés preferred to see them die by fire, sword or the fangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout [sic] the duty and destiny of womanhood. [p.63] But the situation soon deteriorated: Even St. Paul, later the unregenerate prophet of female inferiority, was forced to acknowledge the help he received from Lydia, the seller of purple dyes in Philippi. [ibid.] This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array of four-letter invectives applied to males and by adjectives like brilliant, unusual, inspiring , and so forth to women. Citing a Judaic law-book of the 16th century which identified a woman for the days preceding, during, and following her period as niddah `impure,' Miles has the lack of taste to write the following:. As a final stroke, in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held in store for the Jews, the niddah had to wear special clothing as a badge of her separate and despised status. [p.83] Here and there in this morass of misunderstanding, Miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with the eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell. Campbell, known for his extensive analyses of the world's mythologies, religions, and cultures, noted the marked bias against women emerging from Judaic concepts, later reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrine. Most of the religions of the world connected woman with mother earth, fertility, and all the other progenetic and nurturing associations, and this was borne out in the cultures of the people. According to Campbell, the only godlike female figure in the Bible is the Virgin Mary, and she appears, identified as virgin, only in the Gospel according to Luke. As Luke was a Greek, Campbell suggested that Mary was a carryover from the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheon. Although this might help explain the Judeo-Christian-Muslim tendencies to subjugate women, treating them essentially as chattel, it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures, notably that of Japan. It is not entirely clear whether Campbell was commenting on Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. as they once existed, conceptually, for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religous precepts. Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and that there was no real distinction between gods and goddesses, who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful. With all respect, that seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex for this discussion, though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities (or divinity) when we come to examine Judaism and its congeners and progeny. Other debatable aspects are the questions of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of the theology or the ritual, whether the scripture of any religion should be understood allegorically or literally, and so forth. If there is something wrong, it behooves us to get at the roots of the problem, not to flail about wildly, for only after the source of a disease has been identified can one properly investigate its cure. “History according to Rosalind Miles” blasts away at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating them will effect a cure of the disease. In this jeremiad, males are viewed as the “enemy,” and are so characterized throughout the book, which concludes with exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call to arms (though not men's). Laurence Urdang Archaeology & Language [A VERBATIM Book Club Selection.] Just when you thought it was safe to assume that we now know all we are ever likely to know about the past, someone digs another hole and unearths (literally or figuratively) some ancient artifact: one day it is a fragile scroll, found in a cave near the Dead Sea, that turns out to be pre-Biblical; the next day it is an entire terracotta army of Chinese soldiers: the next it is a skull, excavated from the Olduvai Gorge, that compels anthropologists (once again) to revise their guesses about the earliest stages of Homo sapiens sapiens vs hominids. Most of the relies from the past are gone forever, destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers, reduced to rubble by erosion, by conquerors, by prehistoric (and modern) urban developers, by fire and flood, and just by time. Many, we may hope, have not yet been found. The interest in man's forebears did not become fashionable upon the publication, a few years ago, of Roots : on a far larger scale, we have been trying to discover all we can about the origins not of men but of man. Strange to say, however, that interest does not seem to be more than a few hundred years old: if the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Indians, the Chinese and other peoples were curious about their own prehistory, I have not heard of it. Perhaps the fascination with man's past grew out of the obsession with ruins evinced by Romanticism; certainly, modern archaeology seems to have followed close behind, for the excavation of the supposed site of Troy took place only about 100 years ago. Perhaps it is just as well, for only by the means available to modern science are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts that we find and, through radiocarbon dating, determine their approximate age. Archaeology is a popular pursuit, and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums. Not so paleolinguistics, or the reconstruction of ancient languages. Even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse: Classical Latin and Greek, Hebrew, and a few other languages are better documented than others; but for most all we have to go on are a handful of tablets here, a few inscriptions there, barely enough in many cases to allow us to identify the language, let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning. Perhaps one day we shall find an Etruscan library, buried deep in the Italian countryside; but for the present, we have to make do with what we have, which is precious little. About languages that had no writing system, we know nothing at all. But some very clever comparative linguists, beginning in Germany in the 19th century, theorized about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues. In some instances, ancient languages have been decoded, some from multilingual inscriptions. The work of Jean Francois Champollion (1790-1832) in deciphering hieroglyphics from the Rosetta Stone was an astonishing accomplishment, for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient Egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we have today about their civilization, which lasted for about 2600 years. Another significant break-through was that of Michael Ventris (1922-1956), who deciphered the Linear B script found on Crete and identified it as an early form of Greek. From the standpoint of language, Ventris's work was more important, particularly because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of the early states of Indo-European languages. Many years ago, a linguistic scholar counted all of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence. The total was approximately 2800, but that is probably only a vague estimate: he undoubtedly missed some; some have sprung up since his time (modern Hebrew, for instance); and some have vanished. The exact count is unimportant and, at best, spurious, for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language. Then, too, one must examine the techniques used to group the many languages of the world. Linguists examining Classical Greek, Latin, German, English, Slavic, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Lithuanian, Iranian, Hindi, and the other languages of India and Europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words. Some, like French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, had more in common with one another than they did with, say, German, English, Swedish, Danish, and Dutch, which, in turn, bore only a remote resemblance to Russian and Polish, on the one hand, and the two extant varieties of, say, Gaelic, on the other. One rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes, for after years of laboriously categorizing these languages, the number of different main branches (called families and subfamilies) came to about ten. Ingeniously, certain differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that (inexplicably) took place in one language group but not in another. Although certain other languages were geographically nearby, it was impossible to establish any resemblances between them, hence Basque, for example, is not classified as being in the same family with other European languages, nor are Hungarian and Finnish, both of which belong to their own group. At the conclusion of this vast exercise, done without the aid of computers, there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken, in earlier times, from Britain as far east as Chinese Turkestan and from India as far north as Lappland. Charts showing the chief languages and their derivations can be found in many dictionaries—inside the front cover of The Random House Unabridged , for example. Because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among languages, it is best to avoid using an older chart; for the same reason, it would be wise not to stake too much on the accuracy of even a current chart. The languages discussed here are what are usually called the Indo-European family; similar family trees could be drawn for the Semitic languages, Sino-Tibetan, Japanese, Bantu, Malayo-Polynesian, and so on. Each is a distinct phylum; although there may be word-borrowing among them, lexicon is considered less important in the classification of languages than structure and grammar. It is important, too, to note that writing systems are irrelevant: for instance, Polish is written (today) using the Roman alphabet, but Russian, a related Slavic language, uses the Cyrillic; Yiddish, a Germanic language, is written in Hebrew characters; Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit, which resemble one another rather closely in some respects, all use different alphabets; and early examples, utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages, were written in cuneiform, quite suitable for writing on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus, and hieroglyphics. It would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard to organize languages, they were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials. But only rarely did they collaborate and, with few exceptions, their work was not correlated in a systematic way. Schliemann, who discovered the site of Troy, used the evidence in Homer's Iliad to determine his digging site, where any ruins had long since disappeared from view. In many other places, the ancient sites lay buried—and still do—beneath modern cities: modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below. today, before a new building is erected in London, an archaeological team examines the cleared site for its archaeological significance. But there, as everywhere else, nothing can interfere with progress and, regardless of the finds and their importance, the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer. Notwithstanding, even the brief glimpses afforded by such investigations can provide some insight into civilizations that existed hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of years earlier. Based on the sparse evidence available, linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested. In other words, based on what they knew about a group of languages which were documented, they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from. In most cases, they dealt with words and functional elements, creating what are called reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called, variously, Proto-Latin, Proto-Greek, Proto-Germanic, Proto-Indo-Iranian, and so forth, the ultimate goal being to posit a single language called Proto-Indo-European. That is not entirely true, for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was, literally, a single language from which all Indo-European languages descended. Nonetheless, it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of proto-dialects which can be referred to as Proto-Indo-European. It seems only natural that once an original language, or Ursprache , was posited, the next step was to speculate on its source, or Urheimat . That is what Renfrew has tried to do. Essentially, he proposes that the parent of all Indo-European languages was itself born in central Anatolia, whence it spread eastward, westward, and northward, being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact, till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable, modern manifestations which we categorize into Germanic, Hellenic, Italic, Indo-Iranian, Anatolian, Armenian, Celtic, Tocharian, Albanian, and BaltoSlavic. I have no quarrel with Renfrew's theory—notwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of the Black Sea region and the Volga steppes. It is difficult for the nonspecialist reader (like me) to assess the validity of his arguments, which are based on his contention that the language (and its congeners) were carried along by the spread of nomad pastoralism. Using the evidence available, Renfrew contends that the original Indo-European language, closely related to Hittite, separated after 6500 BC, with the IE languages of western Europe developing from western Anatolia and those of Iran, India, and Pakistan from the eastern division. The choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrew's depends on whether one accepts a “wave” theory, first promulgated more than a hundred years ago by Johnanes Schmidt, a German linguist, or one of indigenous development. Pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture from Turkmenia or a late development of the Indus civilization. Renfrew accepts the wave theory, and in the last two thirds of Archaeology & Language he sets forth his arguments in its favor. Unfortunately, the presentation of his linguistic argument, where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology, where he is on more familiar territory, is disorganized and repetitious. It is difficult to place all the blame on Renfrew, for his editor should have noticed the lack of coherence. The result is an argument that is persuasive but scarely convincing. Nevertheless, good books on archaeology assimilable by laymen are not easy to find, and if the reader can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned about the precise birthplace of Indo-European, Archaelogy & Language provides an interesting march through the millennia of prehistory in seven-league boots. Laurence Urdang Webster's Electronic Thesaurus This software consists of two disks, one labeled Installation and Program, the other Synonym Linguibase, and a manual. The manual sets forth everything with clarity, and the program is simple to install, requiring only a few minutes. Only one thing made me a little suspicious when cranking up the system: in the descriptive text that appears on the screen, the word labeled is spelt “labelled”—decidedly un-American. However, I went ahead, and, since I was typing the text you are reading, returned to the beginning of the paragraph to see how some of these words would fare. I looked up the word preceding and was, after a brief moment, asked to type in the word, which I did. The screen bloomed forth with the following: Query: preceding 1) adj being before especially in time or arrangement There were also some other parts of speech: one definition for the preposition and three for the verb (participial) senses. I called up the synonyms for the adj and the following appeared: Synonyms: antecedent, anterior, foregoing, former, past, precedent, previous, prior The way the program works is this: one uses the cursor to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are desired. It is similar, in principle, to finding a synonym in a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms to find them. I am not sure why, but I expected the program to “network” in the same way. However, when I highlighted antecedent , what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent missing, and preceding had reappeared. If all this is too complicated to follow, let me summarize: you look up word X and get synonyms A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. You look up the synonyms for word A, and you get synonyms X, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Even the definition provided for the sub-listings is identical in wording to that of the word originally sought. This is very economical of space and involves a clever computer ploy, but it does not provide a particularly useful synonym dictionary, for, as we all know, synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative law of mathematics; in language, “Things equal to the same thing are not (necessarily) equal to each other.” Perhaps the Proximity people thought that they had got round that little problem by giving the same definition for each of the items in the list; but we know that only very rarely are two synonyms bi-unique (which is another way of saying that if A = B, B does not necessarily always equal A), an ineluctable fact of language. If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary is likely to be of use, then this package may be of service. It works with a hard disk or with a set of floppies and can be used with 29 popular word-processing programs. (That was the number listed when I received my copy; it might have increased.) It also has a few neat features, like suggesting a few alternatives if you happen to think that preceding is spelt “preceeding” (as many people do). It has a useful “Help” feature that can be called upon at any stage. Also, if you enter jump , you get the synonyms for that; but if you enter jumped , you get the (same) synonyms but inflected—including the variants leapt, leaped for leap . All in all, for a relatively primitive system, it is not too bad; but you would have to be in love with your computer to use it in preference to a far more complete books of synonyms available (especially The Synonym Finder , Rodale in the U.S. and Canada, Longman elsewhere, which offers more than 800,000 synonyms, more than three times the number listed in any other synonym book). The blurb on this book/disk package reads, “Supplies you with 470,000 true synonyms for 40,000 entries.” My guess is that such a quantity might be reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations; in reality, though, there are probably far fewer actual words. Readers can judge for themselves the validity of this numerical legerdemain. Laurence Urdang Family Words In 1962, American Speech published “Family Words in English,” by Allen Walker Read, which was reprinted in VERBATIM Vol. I, No. 4, (1975). The article is a classic, probably the first on the subject to appear in a scholarly journal, though there are other informal references to family language, some of which are documented by Dickson in his Bibliography. Family words and expressions crop up everywhere. Some are quite unique and their reporters cannot imagine their origin; others, like Penn Station , “what one family terms a child's misinterpretation of a famous line or phrase,” are clear: the generic term comes from the Lord's Prayer—“And lead us not into Penn Station.” Obviously, that works only for kids familiar with New York City. Other Penn Stations : Our Father, which art in heaven, Harold be Thy name. Land where the Pilgrims pried. Bells on cocktails ring. I pledge my allowance to the flag. Gladly the cross-eyed bear Onward Christian Soldiers, Marching as to War, With the cross-eyed Jesus, Leaning on the phone. ...One nation, invisible... ...One nation, in a vegetable... Many people know F.H.B. for `family hold back,' an exhortation ensuring ample provender for guests. This is not to suggest that Dickson's book is a catalogue of bloopers, or what Amsel Greene (and Jack Smith) like to call pullet surprises . There are many interesting entries in Family Words which, as far as I know, is the first documentation of the genre. There are occasional hidden entries, as the list of diseases—among them the dread mohogus —under the entry for Fowlenzia . (In the VERBATIM family, some suffer from Fowler's pip , an affliction affecting language fanatics who base a slavish purism on a literal interpretation of Modern English Usage .) Family Words is useful and fun. Inevitably, some of the entries are more imaginative than others; Dickson will have his hands full if everyone responds giving private words. Please sent yours to the author, c/o Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA 01867, not to VERBATIM. Laurence Urdang A Midwesterner, Will Hays, Jr., who is proud of his knowledge of post-Civil-War history, tells me the following origin of shot , as in shotglass , absent from “Gunning for the English Language”: Although we associate trench warfare with World War I, trenches were characteristic also of the Civil War. A scaffold was built so that a rifleman— who fired a single-shot, muzzle-loading shoulder weapon—could step up and shoot over the top of the trench. The soldier in charge would command, after each firing, that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded, thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire. That war, like others, produced disgruntled veterans and those more adventurous or more restless after military service. They moved westward to start a new life. The population increased markedly, with corresponding demands for goods and services, among them the need for saloons. Most new saloons were small and the bars short, accommodating with difficulty the many bunched up, in ranks, if you will, calling for whiskey. Many of the thirsty crowd were veterans, as were many of the bartenders. Thus, “Step down (or back) and give me a shot” was readily understood. I've not been able to corroborate this explanation, but I'll never forget it. Mr. Joseph Hymes' “Do Mistake—Learn Better” [XV,1] brought to mind the time a Japanese acquaintance told me of a friend of hers who decided to tackle the original English version of three books she had enjoyed while in Japan. She boldly marched into a bookstore and asked the salesclerk for a copy each of Hemingway's The Sun Come Up Again and Throw Away the Gun and Steinbeck's The Angry Grape . Is there a term for the errors that creep in while translating a passage back into the original tongue? Mr. Davidson's observations on the Scottishness of Chambers 20th Century Dictionary [XV,1] bear out my own formed over sixteen years of using one. An odd sidelight on this came a few days after reading the article. Definitions under pet end with “Petting Party (coll.) a gathering for the purpose of caressing as an organised sport. (Origin unknown; not from Gaelic)” I think it hardly fanciful to discern a note of Calvinist disapproval in this curt disclaimer. Although I greatly enjoyed Richard Lederer's article, I fear that one of his paragraphs is a load of brass monkey balls. The monkey on board ship was a lad employed to fetch supplies—powder and so forth—to the guns. The word might also have been used for a receptacle near the guns where powder and balls were kept. However, this receptacle would have taken the form of a wooden box or something similar. The idea of a metal stand carrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced as to be affected by the tiny differential expansion of brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a heavy sea. So what is the explanation of the phrase cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey ? Well, the obvious one, I believe. Anybody who asks “Why a brass monkey?” is probably not aware that brass monkeys were very common household ornaments in England in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Originally, they were probably imported from India, but were later mass-produced in places such as Birmingham to grace Victorian and Edwardian mantelshelves. They can still be found today in so-called “gift shops.” Usually, they come in sets of three, one with its hands over its eyes, one over its ears, and one over its mouth: they were said to represent “See no evil, Hear no evil, Speak no evil.” There were various whimsical variants. I am sure I am not the first to point out Joseph Hynes's, “Do Mistake—Learn Better,” [XV,1] mistakes in Japanizing English words, e.g., sei fu not “safe-o,” nain not “nine-o.” The possibilities for representing English with a language of only forty-seven syllables are not that numerous, and the rules are very consistent. The main problems are representing consonant clusters and word-final consonants. These difficulties produce such monstrosities as sutoraike for English `strike'—one syllable in English, five in Japanese. Every Japan veteran has his list of favorite mistakes. Mine are the ones that are possible, but wrong, English. Adding the Japanese final vowels produces Gone with the Windo . Hypercorrection, where Japanese speakers learn that many final vowels do not exist in the American version of the tongue and so remove them, sometimes incorrectly, gives us the California cities of San Francisk and Sacrament . This process resulted in the sign reading Pizz and Coffee . My absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes, however, does not come from the problem of sound. Japanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation or permission—in English, “to make someone or to let someone do something.” One day during a university English class, a very discomfited student, after frantic and obtrusive dictionary work, handed a colleague of mine a scrap of paper. On it was written this sentence: “Please make me go to the bathroom.” You Could Look It Up As everyone in the world must know by now, William Safire writes a column in The New York Times Magazine called “On Language.” Considering the circulation of The New York Times on Sundays, his column is probably the most widely read commentary on contemporary English in the world; that places more than one uncommon burden on a writer: he must do his utmost to be accurate; he must try to select subjects likely to be of interest to his readers; and he must write well. Those familiar with Safire's editorial style, reflected in his political columns on the editorial pages of The N. Y. Times , may agree with me in the contention that when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off: I cannot put my finger on why, but “On Language” always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute. In part, that is attributable to the designation of his correspondents, who keep him informed on language that is not within earshot, as the “Lexicographic Irregulars,” an amusing reference the first time or two it was used but now beginning to cloy. More often than it might prove of interest to me, personally, Safire deals with insiders' language in Washington (where he is based) or with trivialities uttered by some politico. As Andrew Norman wrote, in a letter published in this book on page 113, “You flit freely back and forth between prescriptivism and descriptivism.” But are not many of us guilty of that? We are descriptive of the usages we accept and prescriptive—perhaps proscriptive would be more descriptive—of those we do not like. At least Safire expresses an opinion; whether the reader agrees with him is another matter, as are the questions of his accuracy, which arise fairly often, and that of the suitability of his style, which, as far as I know, has not been broached before. It ill behooves me, excoriated recently as enamored of the “cheap larf,” to criticize Safire's arch puns, which permeate—“enliven” is probably the word his editor would use—his articles, but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable for reading, however they might evoke a chuckle when uttered viva voce . A handful of examples, from the book at hand: Therefore, I stand uncorrected. [p. 112] ...“Get your hand off my knee.” (That's a mnemonic, pronounced knee-MONIC.) Ize Right? [title, p. 114] Juggernaughty but Nice [title, p. 115] ...slanguist...[p. 116] Lex Appeal [title, p. 121] Logue-Rolling [title, p. 123] [on -logue vs. -log:] Some people prefer their logues sawed off...[p. 123] But the Library of Congress wants to be non-U [in its spelling of -logue words]. [ibid.] Writing containing such labored figures makes for hard reading. I am interested in what Safire has to say about language but find myself stymied: I get the feeling that he has deliberately created a minefield of interruptions in thought through which I must pick my way to the end. Notwithstanding the valuable role he plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language and in informing them about myriad facets of the subject, I find it hard slogging (or, as he would probably write, “sloguing”). You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection of Safire's columns and, like the previous collections, contains a selection of letters from readers. It is those that are so sorely missed in his column. True, there is an occasional mention in his column of a point raised by a correspondent, and the Letters section of the Magazine prints a comment from time to time, but an important feature of the books is their inclusion of far more writer-reader interaction than one might suspect from reading the column alone. For one thing, the letter-writers call attention to errors or misinterpretations and are largely critical. Safire cannot be accused of being copy-proud (except, evidently, of awful puns, as in “ Ms. is deliberately msterious , but at least it is not deliberately msleading ” and other mscegenations). There is no gainsaying that Safire is one of the most influential writers on contemporary English, and it is essential that his books be in the libraries of all who are interested in the subject, regardless of their alignment with his opinions. For one thing, he documents many neologisms, an activity that endears him to many working lexicographers. From the sometimes cavalier manner in which he treats his subject, one wonders if Safire feels the burden of the responsibility he has toward his readers. The publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from which this review was prepared; unfortunately, there was no proof of an index, but the publisher has assured me that there will be one in the published book, a rather essential ingredient of a work with this title. Laurence Urdang Webster's New World Guide to Current American Usage Here is a commonsense style book, useful to those who have the education and common sense to be in doubt about questions of English usage. It has some problems, if you want to be sticky about things: on p. xv we read: ...Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity does not say that E = MC² and in leap year MC³. Indeed it does not. But it does say E = mc² ; the version with the capital M and C is, essentially, meaningless to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used in physics. While I acknowledge that it is not easy to know how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a usage book, most reasonable writers have taken a stab at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely place to look, then have provided a detailed index. Not Bernice Randall. True, one can find different from , etc., in an entry so headed, but for absolute constructions one is referred to an entry called “Covered with onions, relish, and ketchup, I ate a hotdog at the ball-park.” If the user wants to find out about misplaced adjectives and adverbs , reference is made to the entry “Electric shaver for women with delicate floral design on the handle.” A search for only would be futile. Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need some lightening up, but I am hard put to agree that they are quite as frivolous and light-headed as this book would have us believe. Fun is fun, but those who might rely on such a book are quite serious about the information they are seeking, and it is unfair to play fast and loose with their sincerity. A sense of humor about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it, but security is the one characteristic often lacking among those who would use Current American Usage . There is no doubt that Randall enjoys her work. But of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms? And of what use are the interminable examples, for instance, of the misuse of like for as , which draw out the entry to three pages? More than four pages are devoted to clichés (under the guise of “Lo and behold, it's man's best friend.,” which, being an exclamation, really ought to end in an exclamation point). The article on British/American English (“There's no home like Eaton Place.”) is a good one, but, at six pages, its utility is questionable. In the matter of pronunciations of BrEng names, it is an old-fashioned fantasy of Americans that Brits go round saying POM-frit for Pontefract : most Brits that I have heard give the name a spelling pronunciation these days; and so with many of the old shibboleths. Of what relevance (to usage, notwithstanding the fact that the topic is interesting) is an entry on eponyms (“John Bull and John Hancock are not just any johns.”)? That is not, strictly speaking, a subject pertinent to the title of the book. All of which is to say that the book is an interesting work on the language and contains accurate, though longwinded information about what it covers, “interesting and useful facts about American English.” Its only real faults are its title, which belies the content, the cutesy headings, and the lack of a truly detailed index: self-indexing does not provide coverage of sufficient detail. As a reference work on usage, it is far from complete: The Simon and Schuster Publicity Department could have used an entry on foreword/ forward (spelt “foreward” in the release accompanying the review copy). A longish section, “Some Troublesome Idiomatic Prepositions,” and a “Glossary of Grammatical and Linguistic Terms Used in This Book,” followed by a list of “References,” sources associated with specific entries, round out the work. Laurence Urdang Language Notes from Abroad “Once more unto the breach for the warriors of 1'Académie Française in their uphill battle to preserve the purity of their native tongue. Examples of franglais which they find particularly monstrous are, I hear, to be condemned to a newly created “Musée des horreurs.” The first is “sponsor, sponsoriser, sponsorisation.” The academy also calls upon all French to send in further examples of “linguistic pollution,” observing ruefully that this is one museum which will be open 12 months a year. But the savants have passed barman, blazer, bobsleigh , and boycott as fit for inclusion in their new dictionary.” [From The Times , 15 January 1988] Letter to the Editor of The Times Penny Perrick regrets (January 11) that “There is no word in English to describe that particular, special sort of pride that one feels in the achievements of one's children.” But the verb kvell , which exactly expresses that emotion, is already (like other Yiddish loanwords, such as chutzpah, meshugga and nosh ) to be found in the Supplement to the Oxford-English Dictionary . If you think that the practice in some Muslim countries of amputating the hand of a thief is harsh, beware of participating in horse shows in England, where there is no capital punishment but the issue arises every few years: A carriage and team of Cleveland Bay horses, driven by Mr Fred Pendlebury...[were] approaching the water obstacle during the cross-country section of the Harrods International Grand Prix when the leading pair became confused, turned back and became entangled with the second pair. Mr Pendlebury, of Smithills, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, was eliminated. [From The Times , 16 May 1988] Loose Cannons & Red Herrings Readers should be familiar with Robert Claiborne's earlier books, especially Our Marvelous Native Tongue: The Life and Times of the English Language . One might say that subtitling the present book “A Book of Lost Metaphors” is an example of a loose canon [sic] — unless metaphor is taken in its broadest sense—but one is unlikely to find red herrings here: the etymologies of a few hundred words and phrases are given, many not readily findable in standard works of reference. The rationale behind referring to them as “lost” arises from the author's observation of an unfortunate state of affairs: because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity with the basic, structural elements of our culture—Greek and Roman mythology, the Bible, literature, and ordinary historical fact—people today are unable to discern the origins of terms like aphrodisiac, Achilles [sic] heel or tendon, meet one's Waterloo, sow dragon's teeth , and hand-writing on the wall , to name a few. There are many, of course, but unaccountably, they are not the focus of this book. Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions like sow one's wild oats , about which he tells us little or nothing: the modern Latinate designation Avena fatua came too many centuries after the original expression to have any relevance to it, so why bring up the information that fatua is Latin for `foolish': it was also Latin for `wild,' which might be more to the point. In any event, it is hard to discern, from the arch style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting, just what is the origin of sow one's wild oats . In many entries, Claiborne labors the obvious, offering little or nothing we do not already know, could easily imagine, or for which the author offers no explanation. Among examples of the first are spit and polish, on the spot, on the square, stick one's neck out , etc. Examples of the last include spill the beans, square the circle, stalemate , etc. Between these is an occasional flash of useful wisdom, much of it pretty well covered by other books of this type (which seem to be proliferating). What is missing, for example, at square the circle , is the information that because the area of a circle is mathematically calculated using pi , which is irrational, there is no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a given circle. But that does not mean that such a square cannot exist. As for stalemate , which is related to checkmate , would it not have been important to indicate that the - mate part has nothing to do with English, having been borrowed from checkmate which is a loanword from Persian (and has nothing to do with check , either). Often, an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology and merely explains the meaning. Does any reader need an entry like this one? straddle . When you straddle a horse, you've got one leg on either side of the animal. When a politican straddles an issue, he's in much the same position. Some speculative suggestions, as the derivation (or reinforcement) from Seidlitz powders for take a powder are sheer nonsense. Not all entries contain misleading, dull, or incorrect information, but those that do not are marked by a lack of originality. Laurence Urdang Word Maps Dialect geography, a branch of dialectology, describes certain features of the dialects of a language and their distribution. The field is about 100 years old. Most prominent among its earliest practitioners in England was Joseph Wright, who prepared the six-volume English Dialect Dictionary , which was published between 1898 and 1905; the best-known contemporary British specialist is Harold Orton. In America, work proceeded space during the 1930s, largely under the direction of Raven McDavid, Hans Kurath, and, later, Harold Allen; more recently, Lee Pedersen and others have investigated American English dialects. Between 1948 and 1961, fieldworkers based at the University of Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialects, which studied 313 localities in England (which, as everyone ought to know, does not include Wales or Scotland). The present book is extracted from the two major works that resulted from the Survey, The Linguistic Atlas of England (1978) and A Word Geography of England (1974), both under the direction of Harold Orton, aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter effort. People generally seem to find dialect study interesting. One letter writer to The Times [21 June 1988] reported: Our close neighbour... in Bere Regis, who was born in the village and who speaks with a delicious Dorset burr, always uses “I” instead of “me.”... “Well, it makes company for I and company for she.” Another of his happy expressions is inner-wards, meaning `since,' as in...“I chucked him out the door and he's not been back innerwards.” Another reported [same date]: Let's get it right. The Bristol for “me” is not “I,” but “oi.” When I was teaching there, the explanation invariably given by boys brought to me for scrapping in the playground was: “Ee it oi, so oi it ee.” The 100 maps selected for representation from the Survey yield information on several hundred words, some of which are clear variants, others quite different lexical entities. For instance, Map 34 shows the areas, marked off by boundary lines, where the variants chimley chimbley, chimmock, chimdey, chimbey , and chimney occur. Map 33 shows the distribution of child (most of southern England) and of bairn (north of a slightly wavy line between Boston, on the Wash to the east, and Lancaster, on the west coast). The authors have provided a brief introduction which is easy to follow, a list of suggested readings, and the names and addresses of the several institutions and societies in Britain where readers may indulge a more intensive interest in dialect study. The maps are clear, each occupying a full page, and the word information is well set forth on them. Where necessary, brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any information that might seem to be out of the ordinary. I have only one nit to pick with the authors. In their description of isoglosses , they write: These are drawn to run midway between/ localities which were shown by the Survey of English Dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of the map. Although it is true that isoglosses, in effect, set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded, more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites either where speakers employ both usages or where speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity. Hence, the term isogloss , from iso - `same' + gloss `word,' to describe the line on a map where the terms are of equal distribution. Isoglosses are to dialect maps what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps, what isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans, etc. The authors are not alone in getting this wrong: it is incorrect in some dictionaries. In those countries where dialect study is undertaken, dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries: the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals, news services, radio, and television; the establishment of “prestige” dialects and, through the media, their promulgation; and the huge population shifts that have taken place, particularly in the U.S. since WWII. Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England, but seem now to be speeding up. There are many other, lesser factors at work, but taken together, all tend toward standardization, especially as the older speakers die off. In some respects, it may not be long before certain aspects of dialect geography will be largely historical. The importance of dialect is emphasized regularly in the press, where we read about people being killed, as in parts of India, because they use the wrong shibboleths. This book is a good introduction to the subject (in England); those familiar with dialectology in America, and those interested in the study in England or, indeed, generally would be well advised to add Word Maps to their libraries. Laurence Urdang American Literary Almanac This is an interesting, useful reference book containing information about the better-known writers of America. It is divided into eighteen chapters varying in length, each dealing with a different aspect of the authors and their works, among them, Writers Related to Writers Schooldays (which colleges and universities spawned which writers) American Literary Pseudonyms American Literary Title Sources Literary Cons: Hoaxes, Frauds, and Plagiarism in American Literature The Profession of Authorship: Authors/Publishers/ Editors/Agents Thrown to the Wolves: Reviews and Reviewers These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography and a detailed Index. As can be seen from the chapter headings, some of the material is trivial, but nonetheless interesting for that. It is not at once apparent why the book is styled an “almanac,” but that is unimportant: there is no other book I know of that contains as much diverse information about American writers as this one. Its readability and organization make it suitable for browsing—even for reading straight through—so in that respect, at least, it does not resemble books in the “Oxford Companion” series. It contains many photographs of writers, some quite early; these enliven the appearance of the book but accomplish little else, unless one is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked like at the age of 15 (as a printer's devil) or in the appearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle of a railroad track in Cleveland in 1916. It is difficult to make any sensible connection between the lives of authors and their creations. A handful might have led colorful existences, some are objects of interest because they died early, committed suicide, were related to (other) famous people, and so forth; but such information seldom reveals as much about their output as do the creations themselves, and in certain cases one is probably better off not knowing quite so much. This book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as an adjunct to most libraries, public and private, large and small, general and specialized. Laurence Urdang “Faculty protest against apartheid at Cornell.” [TV news tease, WHEC, Rochester, . Submitted by .] “[the tenor] brings the opera to its climax in his final suicide.” [From a review of Handel's Tamerlano in the issue of Stereo Review. Submitted by .] I would like to make a couple of comments on articles in the Autumn 1988 issue [XV,2]. Re the article on Cuthbert, Dickens uses intercourse to mean `communication between people' in A Christmas Carol when Scrooge says “I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse” to the third Spirit. I would think that the words grand and stretch would be known to more people than two of the words the author gives as being familiar ( chippy and hootch ). Incidentally, I seem to recall reading somewhere that skins as slang for `dollars' dates from frontier days when trappers used animal skins as currency, and is therefore much older than early 20th-century Harlem. “...the party consisted of Beckett, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Harold Pinter, and the late Alan Webb.” [from The Times Diary , , ]",0
