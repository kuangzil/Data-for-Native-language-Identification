I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First of all, smoking is very harmful. It harms not only people who are smoking but also people who are near smokers. Its smoke smells bad and most non-smokers, including me, do not like the smell of smoke. When they are eating at restaurants, I think that the smell will prevent them from enjoying eating lunch or dinner. So I disagree with smoking at restaurants. Second, I feel that the habit of smoking should be stopped. Smokers pay a lot of money to buy cigarettes and make their health so bad. They may get cancer or other health problems if they continue to smoke. It is a very strange habit and I cannot understand it. Banning smoking at restaurants may help to quit smoking. This is the second reason. It is true that there are still many smokers in Japan. However, in order to have a nice time for all people at restaurants, smoking there should be completely banned. I hope that some day smoking will be banned at all shops or public spaces and the habit of smoking will disappear from Japan.
