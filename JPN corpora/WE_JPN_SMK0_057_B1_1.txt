I agree with the fact that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country First, smoke makes even delicious food bad and the air unclean. Some people enjoy eating special dinner and phenomenon of restaurants. Restaurants are not private place, but public place. Second, today, a lot of restaurants in Japan are separating a non-smoking seat and a smoking seat. But, in fact, that is not perfect. Smoke moves from a smoking seat to a non- smoking seat. Some restautant's owners may make much effort to do that, but it costs a lot of money to rebuild their restaurants. So it is difficult for owners to solve the problem of separation of smoking and non-smoking. Most importantly, some researches said that those who smoke are more likely to get cancer. In Japan, smoking is the second biggest factor of cabcer. And smoking results in the fact that not only peole who smoke but also people who are near smokers are badly affected. On the top of that, smoke has a more terrible effect on non-smokers than smokers. Smokers should have a responsibility for smoking and think about the importance of life. Therefore, I think that the Japanese Government have to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking does more harm than good.
