I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is known by many people that smoking is bad not only for smokers' health, but also health of people around the smoker. This is truth which is proved scientifically. These days, smoking is banned at many public places. Restaurants is also visited by many people and they enjoy eating. No smoking people have the right to keep their health. Moreover, some of them hate the smell of tobacco and mere smell of it makes their feelings bad. Even if no smoking seats and smoking seats are separated at the restraint, it is difficult to shat out the smell completely. In this situation, people who dislikes tobacco cannot enjoy eating at the restaurant. On the other hand, it is not necessary for smokers to smoke when they are eating. If they want to smoke, they have many other ways. They can smoke before their eating at other places. Smokers only have to stand to smoke at eating so that this problem will be solved. Every people can eat at restaurants without unpleasure if Smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
