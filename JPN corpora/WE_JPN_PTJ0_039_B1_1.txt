I agree with that statement. In a university, students are regarded as adults, not children. It is a big difference between university and high school. Surely, they are not prefect adults, but should try to be them. Working is good experience for them. For example, they can talk to someone they might not see without working, old man, foreigner or a man prone to be angry or make you angry. They can see what companies do for their benefit. They can do them if they have a part-time job. Therefore, having a part-time job is important for college students. Of course, a part-time job is not an only important thing. They should study and think about their future. If they are not conscious of those experience and work for just earning money, having a part-time job is not so important. I think for college students to experience many things, the part-time job which you can work just one time or a few times is good. Having a part-time job, they can make many friends. The friends come from different university. So they can get other university's information. University students are not prefect adults and are in the process of becoming them. To be them, they should practice, such as a part-time job.
