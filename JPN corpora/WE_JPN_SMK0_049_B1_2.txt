I agree with the statement. There are several reasons for my idea. First of all, smoking is not good for health. For example, today the number of people who die of cancer is rapidly increasing. I think that the habit of smoking is the most important factor in this fact. At the restaurant there are both smoking people and non-smoking people and it is said that not only smoking people but also people who are in near them suffer from the harm of smoking. In addition to those who are in near smoking people are more likely to become cancer than smoking people. All smoking people should recognize this fact. Secondly, I think that smoking has a bad effect on the sale of restaurants. If there are many smoking people at some restaurant, non-smoking people will try to avoid the restaurant. Then less and less non-smoking people go to the restaurant and of course the sale of the restaurant will be decreasing. These days, as many people are interested in their health, more and more smoking people are trying to stop smoking. However, still there are a lot of people who are smoking in various public spaces. I think that all smoking people should think well about the effect they have on them and those who are in near them. Therefore I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
