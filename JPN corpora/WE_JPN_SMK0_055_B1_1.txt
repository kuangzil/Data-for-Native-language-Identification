I agree with this opinion. And I have three reasons. First reason is that a lot of people don't like cigarette's smokes. I don't like smokes too. When I smell smokes, I feel very bad and sometimes have a headache. Some friends smoke, but when they smoke near me, I ask them to stop smoking. And passive smoking is very bad for our health. So if smoking is banned in restaurants, more people need not to feel bad and enjoy eating lunch or dinner than ever. And children enjoy eating in restaurant with safe. Moreover, it is very good for our health not to have passive smoking. Of course, it is very good for smokers. Second reason is that smoking doesn't make us enjoy eating. If we smoke during eating, we can't enjoy delicious lunch or dinner. Because cigarette's smoke make our sense of tastes bad. In restaurants we should enjoy tastes. Third reason is that I think refraining from smoking is polite manner during eating in public spaces. So I think it is important for smoking to be banned completely in all restaurants in Japan. By doing so, all people from children to the aged enjoy breakfast or lunch or dinner in restaurant with safe.
