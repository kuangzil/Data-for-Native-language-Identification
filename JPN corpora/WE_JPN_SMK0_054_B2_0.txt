I don't agree with the statement. It is true that smoking has bad affections for human body. Recently, it is said that the smoke from tobaccos makes human's lungs bad. This means that people who smoke expose others in danger of becoming ill, especially becoming lung cancer, and dying. People who smoke may become killers sometimes. However, if we completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country, this means that we just care about people who don't smoke. We should think about the rights of people who smoke. They have rights to smoke when they want to do. To protect both rights of people smoke and don't smoke, we should do something, for example, dividing space into a smoking area and a non-smoking area, making a closed space for smoking and so on. We should make our society comfortable for everyone, both people who smoke and don't smoke. So we need to not only do the things I told above but also know about how bad smoking is, why some people really need to smoke, why some people can't quit smoking and so on. Thus, I don't agree with the statement; smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
