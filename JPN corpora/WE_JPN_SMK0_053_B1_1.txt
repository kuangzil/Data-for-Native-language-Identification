I agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The restaurant has many kind of people. For example, child, elderly person, woman who is pregnant, non-smoker and smoker. A smoker smokes and surrounding him people are compelled to smoke secondly. The smoke are gas, so no one smoke without worrying people around him. Almost all of my friends don't smoke at the restaurants in the same reason. Today's economy has been worse. This influence smoker. If you smoke, you should think you need money. Smoke is bad for health as everyone knows. I have seen comparing smoker's lung and that of non-smoker. In a belief sight tell their difference. Non-smoker's lung is pink, but that of smoker is almost black. Tar cause this difference between smoker and non-smoker. I think I must not smoke. The same thing is able to say everyone. My parents used to smoke, so smoke smelling remind me of childhood. My opinion about this is to think time, place and occasion. Smoking should be banned at the restaurants in Japan.
