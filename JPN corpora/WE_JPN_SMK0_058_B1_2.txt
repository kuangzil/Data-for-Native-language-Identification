I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is because it is a problem that we support the side of non-smokers' ideas. Certainly, if the situation won't change, non-smokers get harm. It is said that smoking is bad for health. Smokers probably smoke nevertheless they know this, and non-smokers don't smoke because they don't want to have good health. But they are made to breathe smoke at some restaurants. For them, many restaurants separate smoking spaces and non-smoking spaces. Moreover, some restaurants ban smoking itself. However, I don't think that smoking is banned at ALL the Japanese restaurants is best to solve. it doesn't mean that I agree smoking in restaurants. There is no one who smokes around me and I am sensitive to smells of smoke. So I can't bear even restaurants with smoking and non-smoking spaces. I think they don't have to smoke at the public, eating places like restautrants. They should be able to smoke at their house. Though, smoking isn't banned by Japanese laws, we must not make disadvantages for smokers. smokers are customer as well as non-smokers. Servers have to make an equal attitude for both smokers and non-smokers. I have heard the existence of high level fan before. I don't know much, so I want to learn about that. With this idea, we have chances we don't have to make grim laws. Thus I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
