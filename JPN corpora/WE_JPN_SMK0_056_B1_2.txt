I'm agree with the opinion that all the restaurants in the country should put ban on smoking in the stores. I have two reasons for this. First, smoking is really bad for health. It causes a lot of diseases such as cancer. When I was a three years old, my grandfather died of cancer because he was a smoker. People should stop smoking because no one want to get cancer. Second, smoking has a bad influence not only for smokers but also for people who stay around smokers. In stores, there are a lot of people such as children, infants, old people and so on. So, if they breathe smoke, it really bad for their health and it also make people feel bad. The other day, when I enjoyed having lunch with my friends, the man who had sat at the table next to ours started to smoke. After that, we couldn't enjoy our lunch or talking because of his smoke. Anyway, it is true that smoking is bad for humans. And unfortunately, once people start smoking, it is difficult to stop. So I say again, we should put ban on smoking in all the restaurants in the country to give smokers opportunities to stop smoking, and to stop to spread the bad influence and custom.
