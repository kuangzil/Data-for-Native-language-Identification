I don't think we should absolutely ban smoking in Japan. Because I don't think smoking is very bad. It is sure that smoking is not good for our health. But is it also bad for our mentality? I don't think so. Actually, smoking makes the smoker relax. When they face a serious situation, they smoke in order to be calmed down. Before they do a very important thing, they smoke too. I should think about other people around the smoker. I heard smoking is more harmful for people around the smoker than for the smoker. So smoking is not the problem only for the smoker themselves but also for other people. But is it really that we can solve this problem only by banning smoking completely? I think no. We must have other ways. For example, separating the smoker from the not smoker completely is good way. In this way, both the smoker and the not smoker are satisfied. Actually, in Japan, this way is gradually increasing. We call this way BUNNENN in Japanese. It is not easy to satisfy all people including the smoker or not smoker. So it is not good to decide to ban smoking easily. We should find the other ways. So I disagree this opinion.
