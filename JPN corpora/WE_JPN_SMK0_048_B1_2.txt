I agree with this idea. Today in many public places, smoking is banned. For example, in a station smoking places are separated by box. Most people are beginning to pay attention to smoking. So, smoking in a restaurant is not permitted. There are three reasons for this. First, smoking is very harmful not only for themselves but also for other people around them. It is true that people have freedom of smoking, but I think they should refrain it in public places. I heard that the rate of death of the people who passively smoked becomes much higher than not smoking people. Especially, it affection is dangerous for the pregnant, old and young. Second, people in the restaurant can't enjoy their meal by smoking. Most people's right to enjoy should be protected. Third, smoking itself is not bad habits, but children tend to imitate adult's habits. If many people in Japan smoked, more and more children were likely to smoke. Once men start to smoke, it is very difficult to stop smoking soon by themselves. Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at not only all the restaurants in the country but also at many public places in Japan.
