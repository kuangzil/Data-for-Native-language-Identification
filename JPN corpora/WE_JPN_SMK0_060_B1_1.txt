I disagree with the statement. In my opinion, people should not smoke because smoking is very harmful not only for smokers but also for people around them, and there are a lot of people who do not like cigarette. So, basically, I think that smoking should be banned at public places. However, I don't think that smoking have to be banned at all the restaurants in the country, because there are a lot of people who can't calm down without smoking cigarette and want to smoke in restaurants. If smoking is banned at all the restaurants, such people can't go restaurants forever. It is unfair for smokers. So, I think that all the restaurants should prepare both of non-smoking seats and smoking seats. If they separate the two seats, people who like smoking cigarette can enjoy smoking, not caring about people around them, and people who do not like smoking cigarette can enjoy eating, not being bothered by smokers. In my experience, there are many restaurants which prepare the two seats, but do not separate the two seats completely, so people who do not like cigarette are bothered by smokers even though they sit in non-smoking seats. So what is important for restaurants is that they prepare the two seats completely.
