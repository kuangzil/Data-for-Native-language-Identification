I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, a restaurant is a place where people can eat dishes and feel comfortable. Although some smokers may feel relaxed when they smoke, other people don't feel so when there is a thick smoke at a restaurant. If smokers want to smoke, they should smoke at smoking area or their home. Secondly, smoking affects not only smokers themselves but also other people. At a restaurant, there are many people from children to the elderly people. Even if people don't smoke, and are in good health, second-hand smoke is very harmful to them. This is because second-hand smoke is worse than smoke which smokers breathe directly from tobacco. And we can't protect ourselves from smoke in the air when we eat dishes and talk at a restaurant. It's terrible thing to be ill because of second-hand smoke. Lastly, a restaurant is one of public places. So every people should consider about other people each other. It is an important manner to stop smoking in public places. Although it should be hard for smokers, they need to recognize how smoking damages other people's health. By these reasons, I support the idea that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country.
