I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking makes trouble for non-smokers around smokers. First, smoking does harm for not only smokers themselves, but also non-smokers around them—in fact much more harm for non-smokers than for smokers. As you know, smoking can cause lung cancer. Smoking at a restaurant means causing great damage to next tables. I think it is not fair that non-smokers suffer such damage. Second, many non-smokers don't like the smell of smoke, and smoking near them makes them feel bad. They don't want to eat at the table next to smokers'. Recently, restrains which separate smokers and non-smokers have been increasing in Japan, but many restaurants just divided tables into two parts—one allowed to smoke, another banned to smoke. After all, smokers and non-smokers are in the same room, and it is no good. To protect non-smokers, complete separation is necessary. At such a restaurant, the room for smokers is full of smoke, and I think that none can enjoy dishes there. Thesedays smokers have decreasing places where they are allowed to smoke. So they may be complaining about that—where can we smoke? I think smoking should be completely banned at all public place.
