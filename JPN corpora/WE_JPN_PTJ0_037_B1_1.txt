I agree with the statement. Collage student had better have a part-time job. First, we can learn how our society going on through a part-time job. For example, we know how hard to earn the money. We realize that we should use the money for what we really need. And we use things which we bought with our own money long and safety. Second, we can meet a lot of people regardless of age and sex to have a part-time job. At work place, there are many people who have various kinds of back ground. Taking with them, we can gain our knowledge for our lives. Third, we can experience so many kind of job. Such as tutor, shop clerk, waiter, waitress, and so on. We know there are many kinds of jobs in the world. It helps us to find what we really want to do in the future. And we can find a door to be a businessman. The most important thing is trying to do many jobs. We have a lot of time. So this four years is chance to develop our humanity. So I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job.
