Non-smokers generally find it offensive when they enter restaurants to find that people sitting at the next table are smoking. This is because the smell of the smoke usually annoys them, and they cannot truly enjoy the food. I am also a non-smoker, and I find this situation to be very offensive, but I do not think that smoking should be banned completely at restaurants throughout Japan. Even though we non-smokers find it annoying that people like to smoke in restaurants, it is natural for smokers to smoke during meals. To smokers, the habit of smoking while eating is sort of like a lifestyle, just like it is normal for non-smokers to not smoke while eating. So, I think that it is unfair for us to enforce our way of enjoying food to those that like to smoke while they enjoy food. Instead of arguing about whether or not to ban smoking in restaurants, I think that it is important that we search for ways to have both non-smokers and smokers eat in the same restaurant without any conflict. We should keep the rule of having both smoking and non-smoking tables, and try to come up with new ways on preventing the smoke from the smoking tables, from reaching the non-smokers. Smoking is permitted in many places in Japan, and many non-smokers are not happy about it. However, banning smoking everywhere will not completely solve the problem, so it is important for us to think of how to make more tolerable environments for non-smokers.
