I disagree with the statement. Certainly, it is said that the number of people who smoke is reducing. And smoking does harm not only to people who smoke themselves but also to people around them, for example, their family and their colleagues and so on. But some people still want to smoke and by doing so, they can relax. So if smoking is banned at all the restaurants in the country, smoking people have to give up eating out or cannot relax when they're eating out all their lives. And also, if smoking is banned at all the restaurants, smoking will soon be banned in many public places or other shops and smoking people will be hard to live. So we need to understand the feelings that smoking people want to smoke and cannot give up smoking and we have to protect the rights of smokers. But I think that smokers have to follow the rules, too. For example, smoking people must not smoke at the place where smoking is banned. And also, smoking people have to pay attention not to do harm to people around them. When we follow the rules and understand each other, we don't get angry or upset and live together peacefully and happily.
